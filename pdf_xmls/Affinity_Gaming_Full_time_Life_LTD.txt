                                                        STATE OF ILLINOIS

                                     The Religious Freedom Protection and Civil Union Act

                                                       Effective June 1, 2011


         The Religious Freedom Protection and Civil Union Act ("the Act") creates a legal relationship between two

         persons of the same or opposite sex who form a civil union. The Act provides that the parties to a civil

         union are entitled to the same legal obligations, responsibilities, protections and benefits that are afforded

         or recognized by the laws of Illinois to spouses. The law further provides that a party to a civil union shall

         be included in any definition or use of the terms "spouse," "family," "immediate family," "dependent," "next

         of kin," and other terms descriptive of spousal relationships as those terms are used throughout Illinois

         law. This includes the terms "marriage" or "married," or variations thereon. Insurance policies are required

         to provide identical benefits and protections to both civil unions and marriages. If policies of insurance

         provide coverage for children, the children of civil unions must also be provided coverage. The Act also

         requires recognition of civil unions or same sex civil unions or marriages legally entered into in other

         jurisdictions.


         For more information regarding the Act, refer to 750 ILCS 75/1 et seq. Examples of the interaction

         between the Act and existing law can be found in the Illinois Insurance Facts, Civil Unions and Insurance

         Benefits    document      available    on    the   Illinois Department       of  Insurance's     website    at

       delegated to Us the fiduciary responsibility to determine eligibility for benefits and to construe and interpret all

       terms and provisions of The Policy. Therefore, We are a fiduciary for The Policy and We have the continuing

       claim for benefits which is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, then You may file suit in state or federal court for

       coverage may be reinstated, provided You request such reinstatement upon Your or Your Dependents' release

       Other sources of income are plans or arrangements of coverage that provide disability-related benefits such as

       Worker's Compensation or other similar governmental programs or laws, or disability-related benefits received

       association or other organization. Other sources of income include disability-related benefits under the United States

       Social Security Act or an alternate governmental plan, the Railroad Retirement Act, and other similar plans or acts.

       Other sources of income may also include certain disability-related or retirement benefits that you receive because

       of your retirement unless you were receiving them prior to becoming disabled.


       What comprises other sources of income under the policy is determined by the nature of the policyholder. Therefore,

       we strongly urge you to Read Your Certificate Carefully. A full description of the plans and types of plans

       considered to be other sources of income under the policy will be found in the definition of "Other Income

       Benefits" located in the Definitions section of your certificate.

       notice of cancellation, to change such a designation and, to have the Policy reinstated if the insured suffers from

       cognitive impairment or functional incapacity and the ground for cancellation was the insured's nonpayment of

       premium or other lapse or default on the part of the insured.

          1) You, any person authorized to act on Your behalf, or any of Your dependents may request reinstatement

               of The Policy within 90 days following cancellation of The Policy for nonpayment of premium provided

Utah:

   1. If the Sending Proof of Loss provision provides a timeframe in which proof must be submitted before it affects

      Your claim, this time limitation shall not apply to You.


Vermont:

   1. The following requirement applies:


      Purpose: Vermont law requires that health insurers offer coverage to parties to a civil union that is equivalent to

      coverage provided to married persons.


      Definitions, Terms, Conditions and Provisions: The definitions, terms, conditions or any other provisions of

      the policy, contract, certificate and/or riders and endorsements are hereby superseded as follows:

      1) Terms that mean or refer to a marital relationship, or that may be construed to mean or refer to a marital

          relationship, such as "marriage", "spouse", "husband", "wife", "dependent", "next of kin", "relative",

          "beneficiary", "survivor", "immediate family" and any other such terms, include the relationship created by a

          civil union established according to Vermont law.

      2) Terms that mean or refer to the inception or dissolution of a marriage, such as "date of marriage", "divorce

          decree", "termination of marriage" and any other such terms include the inception or dissolution of a civil

          union established according to Vermont law.

      3) Terms that mean or refer to family relationships arising from a marriage, such as "family", "immediate family",

          "dependent", "children", "next of kin", "relative", "beneficiary", "survivor" and any other such terms include

          family relationships created by a civil union established according to Vermont law.

      4) "Dependent" means a spouse, a party to a civil union established according to Vermont law, and a child or

          children (natural, stepchild, legally adopted or a minor or disabled child who is dependent on the insured for

          support and maintenance) who is born to or brought to a marriage or to a civil union established according to

          Vermont law.

      5) "Child or covered child" means a child (natural, step-child, legally adopted or a minor or disabled child who is

          dependent on the insured for support and maintenance) who is born to or brought to a marriage or to a civil

          union established according to Vermont law.


          CAUTION: FEDERAL LAW RIGHTS MAY OR MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE

          Vermont law grants parties to a civil union the same benefits, protections and responsibilities that flow from

          marriage under state law. However, some or all of the benefits, protections and responsibilities related to

          health insurance that are available to married persons under federal law may not be available to parties to a

          civil union. For example, federal law, the Employee Income Retirement Security Act of 1974 known as

          "ERISA", controls the employer/employee relationship with regard to determining eligibility for enrollment in

          private employer health benefit plans. Because of ERISA, Act 91 does not state requirements pertaining to a

          private employer's enrollment of a party to a civil union in an ERISA employee welfare benefit plan. However,

          governmental employers (not federal government) are required to provide health benefits to the dependents

          of a party to a civil union if the public employer provides health benefits to the dependents of married persons.

          Federal law also controls group health insurance continuation rights under COBRA for employers with 20 or

          more employees as well as the Internal Revenue Code treatment of health insurance premiums. As a result,

          parties to a civil union and their families may or may not have access to certain benefits under the policy,

          contract, certificate, rider or endorsement that derive from federal law. You are advised to seek expert advice

          to determine your rights under this contract.

greater than the next higher option from Your current coverage will be subject to Your submission of an application that

meets Our approval.


When will a requested change in benefit option take effect?

If You enroll for a change in benefit option during an Annual Enrollment Period, the change will take effect on the later of:

    1) the first day of the month following the Annual Enrollment Period; or

    2) the date We approve Your Evidence of Insurability if You are required to submit Evidence of Insurability.

Any such increase in coverage is subject to the following provisions:

    1) Deferred Effective Date; and

    2) Pre-existing Conditions Limitations.


Do coverage amounts change if there is a change in my class or my rate of pay?

Your coverage may increase or decrease on the date there is a change in Your class or Pre-disability Earnings. However,

no increase in coverage will be effective unless on that date You:

    1) are an Active Employee; and

    2) are not absent from work due to being Disabled. If You were so absent from work, the effective date of such

         increase will be deferred until You are Actively at Work for one full day.


No change in Your Pre-disability Earnings will become effective until the date We receive notice of the change.

Any increase or decrease in coverage because of a change in The Policy will become effective on the date of the change,

subject to the following provisions:

    1) the Deferred Effective Date provision; and

    2) Pre-existing Conditions Limitations.

on the day before the Policy Effective Date, the Deferred Effective Date provision will not apply.


Is my coverage under The Policy subject to the Pre-existing Condition Limitation?

If You become insured under The Policy on the Policy Effective Date and were covered under the Prior Policy on the day

before the Policy Effective Date, the Pre-existing Conditions Limitation will end on the earliest of:

    1) the Policy Effective Date, if Your coverage for the Disability was not limited by a pre-existing condition restriction

         under the Prior Policy; or

    2) the date the restriction would have ceased to apply had the Prior Policy remained in force, if Your coverage was

         limited by a pre-existing condition limitation under the Prior Policy.


The amount of the Monthly Benefit payable for a Pre-existing Condition in accordance with the above paragraph will be

the lesser of:

    1) the Monthly Benefit which was paid by the Prior Policy; or

    2) the Monthly Benefit provided by The Policy.


The Pre-existing Conditions Limitation will apply after the Policy Effective Date to the amount of a benefit increase which

results from a change from the Prior Policy to The Policy, a change in benefit options, a change of class or a change in

The Policy.


Do I have to satisfy an Elimination Period under The Policy if I was Disabled under the Prior Policy?

Employee before the Policy Effective Date, then, if within 6 months of Your return to work:

    1) You have a recurrence of the same disability while covered under The Policy; and

    2) there are no benefits available for the recurrence under the Prior Policy;

the Elimination Period, which would otherwise apply, will be waived if the recurrence would have been covered without

any further elimination period under the Prior Policy.

    3) the date premium payment is due but not paid;

    4) the last day of the period for which You make any required premium contribution;

    5) the date Your Employer terminates Your employment; or

    6) the date You cease to be a Full-time Active Employee in an eligible class for any reason;

unless continued in accordance with any of the Continuation Provisions.


                                                               19

Continuation Provisions: Can my coverage be continued beyond the date it would otherwise terminate?

Coverage can be continued by Your Employer beyond a date shown in the Termination provision, if Your Employer

provides a plan of continuation which applies to all employees the same way. Continued coverage:

    1) is subject to any reductions in The Policy;

    2) is subject to payment of premium by the Employer; and

    3) terminates if:

         a) The Policy terminates; or

         b) coverage for Your class terminates.


In any event, Your benefit level, or the amount of earnings upon which Your benefits may be based, will be that in effect

on the day before Your coverage was continued. Coverage may be continued in accordance with the above restrictions

and as described below:


Leave of Absence: If You are on a documented leave of absence, other than Family and Medical Leave or Military Leave

of Absence, Your coverage (including Dependent Coverage) may be continued for 9 month(s) after the month in which the

leave of absence commenced. If the leave terminates prior to the agreed upon date, this continuation will cease

immediately.


Severance: If Your employment terminates and continuation of long term disability insurance is available to You in a

severance plan sponsored by the Employer, Your coverage may be continued. Your coverage will continue until the

earliest of:

    1) The date the Policy terminates;

    2) The date You become covered under another group long term disability insurance policy;

    3) The date specified in Your severance plan; or

    4) 90 days from the date Your employment terminates.


Family and Medical Leave: If You are granted a leave of absence, in writing, according to the Family and Medical Leave

Act of 1993, or other applicable state or local law, Your coverage may be continued for up to 12 weeks, or 26 weeks if

You qualify for Family Military Leave, or longer if required by other applicable law, following the date Your leave

commenced. If the leave terminates prior to the agreed upon date, this continuation will cease immediately.


Coverage while Disabled: Does my insurance continue while I am Disabled and no longer an Active Employee?

If You are Disabled and You cease to be an Active Employee, Your insurance will be continued:

    1) during the Elimination Period while You remain Disabled by the same Disability; and

    2) after the Elimination Period for as long as You are entitled to benefits under The Policy.


Waiver of Premium: Am I required to pay premiums while I am Disabled?

No premium will be due for You:

    1) after the Elimination Period; and

    2) for as long as benefits are payable.


Extension of Benefits for Disability: Do my benefits continue if The Policy terminates?

If You are entitled to benefits while Disabled and The Policy terminates, benefits:

    1) will continue as long as You remain Disabled by the same Disability; but

    2) will not be provided beyond the date We would have ceased to pay benefits had the insurance remained in force.

Termination of The Policy for any reason will have no effect on Our liability under this provision.




                                                         BENEFITS

Disability Benefit: What are my Disability Benefits under The Policy?

We will pay You a Monthly Benefit if You:

    1) become Disabled while insured under The Policy;

    2) are Disabled throughout the Elimination Period;

    3) remain Disabled beyond the Elimination Period; and

    4) submit Proof of Loss to Us.

Benefits accrue as of the first day after the Elimination Period and are paid monthly. However, benefits will not exceed

the Maximum Duration of Benefits.


                                                              20

Mental Illness and Substance Abuse Benefits: Are benefits limited for Mental Illness or Substance Abuse?

If You are Disabled because of:

     1) Mental Illness that results from any cause;

     2) any condition that may result from Mental Illness;

     3) alcoholism; or

     4) the non-medical use of narcotics, sedatives, stimulants, hallucinogens, or any other such substance;

then, subject to all other provisions of The Policy, We will limit the Maximum Duration of Benefits.


Benefits will be payable:

     1) for as long as You are confined in a hospital or other place licensed to provide medical care for the disabling

         condition; or

     2) if not confined, or after You are discharged and still Disabled, for a total of 12 months for all such disabilities

         during Your lifetime.


Recurrent Disability: What happens if I Recover but become Disabled again?

Periods of Recovery during the Elimination Period will not interrupt the Elimination Period, if the number of days You

return to work as an Active Employee are less than one-half (1/2) the number of days of Your Elimination Period.


Any day within such period of Recovery, will not count toward the Elimination Period.


After the Elimination Period, if You return to work as an Active Employee and then become Disabled and such Disability

is:

     1) due to the same cause; or

     2) due to a related cause; and

     3) within 6 months of the return to work;

the Period of Disability prior to Your return to work and the recurrent Disability will be considered one Period of Disability,

provided The Policy remains in force.


If You return to work as an Active Employee for 6 months or more, any recurrence of a Disability will be treated as a new

Disability. The new Disability is subject to a new Elimination Period and a new Maximum Duration of Benefits.


Period of Disability means a continuous length of time during which You are Disabled under The Policy.


Recover or Recovery means that You are no longer Disabled and have returned to work with the Employer and

premiums are being paid for You.


Calculation of Monthly Benefit: Return to Work Incentive: How are my Disability benefits calculated?

If You remain Disabled after the Elimination Period, but work while You are Disabled, We will determine Your Monthly

Benefit for a period of up to 12 consecutive months as follows:

     1) multiply Your Pre-disability Earnings by the Benefit Percentage;

     2) compare the result with the Maximum Benefit; and

     3) from the lesser amount, deduct Other Income Benefits.

The result is Your Monthly Benefit. Current Monthly Earnings will not be used to reduce Your Monthly Benefit. However, if

the sum of Your Monthly Benefit and Your Current Monthly Earnings exceeds 100% of Your Pre-disability Earnings, We

will reduce Your Monthly Benefit by the amount of excess.


The 12 consecutive month period will start on the last to occur of:

     1) the day You first start work; or

     2) the end of the Elimination Period.


If You are Disabled and not receiving benefits under the Return to Work Incentive, We will calculate Your Monthly Benefit

as follows:

     1) multiply Your Monthly Income Loss by the Benefit Percentage;

     2) compare the result with the Maximum Benefit; and

     3) from the lesser amount, deduct Other Income Benefits.

The result is Your Monthly Benefit.


Calculation of Monthly Benefit: What happens if the sum of my Monthly Benefit, Current Monthly Earnings, and Other

Income Benefits exceeds 100% of my Pre-disability Earnings?


                                                               21

If the sum of Your Monthly Benefit, Current Monthly Earnings, and Other Income Benefits exceeds 100% of Your Pre-

disability Earnings, We will reduce Your Monthly Benefit by the amount of the excess. However, Your Monthly Benefit will

not be less than the Minimum Monthly Benefit.


If an overpayment occurs, We may recover all or any portion of the overpayment, in accordance with the Overpayment

Recovery provision.


Minimum Monthly Benefit: Is there a Minimum Monthly Benefit?

Your Monthly Benefit will not be less than the Minimum Monthly Benefit shown in the Schedule of Insurance.


Partial Month Payment: How is the benefit calculated for a period of less than a month?

If a Monthly Benefit is payable for a period of less than a month, We will pay 1/30 of the Monthly Benefit for each day You

were Disabled.


Termination of Payment: When will my benefit payments end?

Benefit payments will stop on the earliest of:

     1) the date You are no longer Disabled;

     2) the date You fail to furnish Proof of Loss;

     3) the date You are no longer under the Regular Care of a Physician;

     4) the date You refuse Our request that You submit to an examination by a Physician or other qualified medical

         professional;

     5) the date of Your death;

     6) the date You refuse to receive recommended treatment that is generally acknowledged by Physicians to cure,

         correct or limit the disabling condition;

     7) the last day benefits are payable according to the Maximum Duration of Benefits Table;

     8) the date Your Current Monthly Earnings:

         a) are equal to or greater than 80% of Your Indexed Pre-disability Earnings if You are receiving benefits for

             being Disabled from Your Occupation; or

         b) are greater than the lesser of the product of Your Indexed Pre-disability Earnings and the Benefit Percentage

             or the Maximum Monthly Benefit if You are receiving benefits for being Disabled from Any Occupation;

     9) the date no further benefits are payable under any provision in The Policy that limits benefit duration; or

     10) the date You refuse to participate in a Rehabilitation program, or refuse to cooperate with or try:

         a) modifications made to the work site or job process to accommodate Your identified medical limitations to

             enable You to perform the Essential Duties of Your Occupation;

         b) adaptive equipment or devices designed to accommodate Your identified medical limitations to enable You to

             perform the Essential Duties of Your Occupation;

         c) modifications made to the work site or job process to accommodate Your identified medical limitations to

             enable You to perform the Essential Duties of Any Occupation, if You were receiving benefits for being

             disabled from Any Occupation; or

         d) adaptive equipment or devices designed to accommodate Your identified medical limitations to enable You to

             perform the Essential Duties of Any Occupation, if You were receiving benefits for being disabled from Any

             Occupation;

         provided a qualified Physician or other qualified medical professional agrees that such modifications,

         Rehabilitation program or adaptive equipment accommodate Your medical limitation.


Family Care Credit Benefit: What if I must incur expenses for Family Care Services in order to participate in a

Rehabilitation program?

If You are working as part of a program of Rehabilitation, We will, for the purpose of calculating Your benefit, deduct the

cost of Family Care from earnings received from work as a part of a program of Rehabilitation, subject to the following

limitations:

     1) Family Care means the care or supervision of:

         a) Your children under age 13; or

         b) a member of Your household who is mentally or physically handicapped and dependent upon You for support

             and maintenance;

     2) the maximum monthly deduction allowed for each qualifying child or family member is:

         a) $350 during the first 12 months of Rehabilitation; and

         b) $175 thereafter;

         but in no event may the deduction exceed the amount of Your monthly earnings;

     3) Family Care Credits may not exceed a total of $2,500 during a calendar year;

     4) the deduction will be reduced proportionally for periods of less than a month;

                                                              22

     5) the charges for Family Care must be documented by a receipt from the caregiver;

     6) the credit will cease on the first to occur of the following:

         a) You are no longer in a Rehabilitation program; or

         b) Family Care Credits for 24 months have been deducted during Your Disability; and

     7) no Family Care provided by someone Related to the family member receiving the care will be eligible as a

         deduction under this provision.


Your Current Monthly Earnings after the deduction of Your Family Care Credit will be used to determine Your Monthly

Income Loss. In no event will You be eligible to receive a Monthly Benefit under The Policy if Your Current Monthly

Earnings before the deduction of the Family Care Credit exceed 80% of Your Indexed Pre-disability Earnings.


Survivor Income Benefit: Will my survivors receive a benefit if I die while receiving Disability Benefits?

If You were receiving a Monthly Benefit at the time of Your death, We will pay a Survivor Income Benefit, when We

receive proof satisfactory to Us:

     1) of Your death; and

     2) that the person claiming the benefit is entitled to it.

We must receive the satisfactory proof for Survivor Income Benefits within 1 year of the date of Your death.


The Survivor Income Benefit will only be paid:

     1) to Your Surviving Spouse; or

     2) if no Surviving Spouse, in equal shares to Your Surviving Children.

If there is no Surviving Spouse or Surviving Children, then no benefit will be paid.


However, We will first apply the Survivor Income Benefit to any overpayment which may exist on Your claim.


If a minor child is entitled to benefits, We may, at Our option, make benefit payments to the person caring for and

supporting the child until a legal guardian is appointed.


The Survivor Income Benefit is calculated as 3 times the lesser of:

     1) Your Monthly Income Loss multiplied by the Benefit Percentage in effect on the date of Your death; or

     2) The Maximum Monthly Benefit.


Surviving Spouse means Your spouse who was not legally separated or divorced from You or Your domestic partner

who has not legally terminated the domestic partnership from You when You died.

"Spouse" will include Your domestic partner provided You:

     1) have executed a domestic partner affidavit satisfactory to Us, establishing that You and Your partner are domestic

         partners for purposes of The Policy; or

     2) have registered as domestic partners with a government agency or office where such registration is available and

         provide proof of such registration unless requiring proof is prohibited by law.


Surviving Children means Your unmarried children, step children, legally adopted children who, on the date You die, are

primarily dependent on You for support and maintenance and who are under age 25.


The term Surviving Children will also include any other children related to You by blood or marriage or domestic

partnership and who:

     1) lived with You in a regular parent-child relationship; and

     2) were eligible to be claimed as dependents on Your federal income tax return for the last tax year prior to Your

         death.


Workplace Modification Benefit: Will the Rehabilitation program provide for modifications to my workplace to

accommodate my return to work?

We will reimburse Your Employer for the expense of reasonable Workplace Modifications to accommodate Your

Disability and enable You to return to work as an Active Employee. You qualify for this benefit if:

     1) Your Disability is covered by The Policy;

     2) the Employer agrees to make modifications to the workplace in order to reasonably accommodate Your return to

         work and the performance of the Essential Duties of Your job; and

Benefits paid for such Workplace Modification shall not exceed the amount equal to the amount of the Maximum Monthly

Benefit.

                                                                23

We have the right, at Our expense, to have You examined or evaluated by:

    1) a Physician or other health care professional; or

    2) a vocational expert or rehabilitation specialist;

of Our choice so that We may evaluate the appropriateness of any proposed modification.


We will reimburse the Employer's costs for approved Workplace Modifications after:

    1) the proposed modifications made on Your behalf are complete;

    2) We have been provided written proof of the expenses incurred to provide such modification; and

    3) You have returned to work as an Active Employee.


Workplace Modification means change in Your work environment, or in the way a job is performed, to allow You to

perform, while Disabled, the Essential Duties of Your job. Payment of this benefit will not reduce or deny any benefit You

are eligible to receive under the terms of The Policy.

You must give Us written notice of a claim within 30 days after Disability or loss occurs. Failure to give notice within such

When We determine that You;

    1) are Disabled; and

                                                               25

We will pay accrued benefits at the end of each month that You are Disabled. We may, at Our option, make an advance

benefit payment based on Our estimated duration of Your Disability. If any payment is due after a claim is terminated, it

will be paid as soon as Proof of Loss satisfactory to Us is received.


Benefits may be subject to interest payments as required by applicable law.

     4) provide an explanation of the review procedure.


Claim Appeal: What recourse do I have if my claim is denied?

On any claim, You or Your representative may appeal to Us for a full and fair review. To do so You:

     1) must request a review upon written application within:

         a) 180 days of receipt of claim denial if the claim requires Us to make a determination of disability; or

         b) 60 days of receipt of claim denial if the claim does not require Us to make a determination of disability; and

     2) may request copies of all documents, records, and other information relevant to Your claim; and

     3) may submit written comments, documents, records and other information relating to Your claim.


We will respond to You in writing with Our final decision on the claim.


Social Security: When must I apply for Social Security Benefits?

You must apply for Social Security disability benefits when the length of Your Disability meets the minimum duration

required to apply for such benefits. You must apply within 45 days from the date of Our request. If the Social Security

Administration denies Your eligibility for benefits, You will be required:

     1) to follow the process established by the Social Security Administration to reconsider the denial; and

     2) if denied again, to request a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge of the Office of Hearing and Appeals.


Benefit Estimates: How does the Company estimate Disability benefits under the United States Social Security Act?

We reserve the right to reduce Your Monthly Benefit by estimating the Social Security disability benefits You or Your

spouse and children may be eligible to receive.


When We determine that You or Your dependent may be eligible for benefits, We may estimate the amount of these

benefits. We may reduce Your Monthly Benefit by the estimated amount.

Your Monthly Benefit will not be reduced by estimated Social Security disability benefits if:

     1) You apply for Social Security disability benefits and pursue all required appeals in accordance with the Social

         Security provision; and

     2) You have signed a form authorizing the Social Security Administration to release information about awards

         directly to Us; and

     3) You have signed and returned Our reimbursement agreement, which confirms that You agree to repay all

         overpayments.


If We have reduced Your Monthly Benefit by an estimated amount and:

     1) You or Your dependent are later awarded Social Security disability benefits, We will adjust Your Monthly Benefit

         when We receive proof of the amount awarded, and determine if it was higher or lower than Our estimate; or




                                                                 26

     2) Your application for Social Security disability benefits has been denied, We will adjust Your Monthly Benefit when

         You provide Us proof of final denial from which You cannot appeal from an Administrative Law Judge of the Office

         of Hearing and Appeals.


If Your Social Security benefits were lower than We estimated, and We owe You a refund, We will make such refund in a

lump sum. If Your Social Security benefits were higher than We estimated, and if Your Monthly Benefit has been

overpaid, You must make a lump sum refund to Us equal to all overpayments, in accordance with the Overpayment

Recovery provision.


Overpayment: When does an overpayment occur?

An overpayment occurs:

     1) when We determine that the total amount We have paid in benefits is more than the amount that was due to You

         under The Policy; or

     2) when payment is made by Us that should have been made under another group policy.


This includes, but is not limited to, overpayments resulting from:

     1) retroactive awards received from sources listed in the Other Income Benefits definition;

     2) failure to report, or late notification to Us of any Other Income Benefit(s) or earned income;

     3) misstatement;

     4) fraud; or

     5) any error We may make.


Overpayment Recovery: How does the Company exercise the right to recover overpayments?

We have the right to recover from You any amount that We determine to be an overpayment. You have the obligation to

refund to Us any such amount. Our rights and Your obligations in this regard may also be set forth in the reimbursement

agreement You will be required to sign when You become eligible for benefits under The Policy.


If benefits are overpaid on any claim, You must reimburse Us within 30 days.


If reimbursement is not made in a timely manner, We have the right to:

     1) recover such overpayments from:

         a) You;

         b) any other organization;

         c) any other insurance company;

         d) any other person to or for whom payment was made; and

         e) Your estate;

     2) reduce or offset against any future benefits payable to You or Your survivors, including the Minimum Monthly

         Benefit, until full reimbursement is made. Payments may continue when the overpayment has been recovered;

     3) refer Your unpaid balance to a collection agency; and

     4) pursue and enforce all legal and equitable rights in court.


Subrogation: What are the Company's subrogation rights?

If You:

     1) suffer a Disability because of the act or omission of a Third Party;

     2) become entitled to and are paid benefits under The Policy in compensation for lost wages; and

     3) do not initiate legal action for the recovery of such benefits from the Third Party in a reasonable period of time;

then We will be subrogated to any rights You may have against the Third Party and may, at Our option, bring legal action

against the Third Party to recover any payments made by Us in connection with the Disability.


Third Party as used in this provision, means any person or legal entity whose act or omission, in full or in part, causes

You to suffer a Disability for which benefits are paid or payable under The Policy.


Reimbursement: What are the Company's Reimbursement Rights?

We have the right to request to be reimbursed for any benefit payments made or required to be made under The Policy for

a Disability for which You recover payment from a Third Party.


If You recover payment from a Third Party as:

     a) a legal judgment;

     b) an arbitration award; or

     c) a settlement or otherwise;

                                                                27

You must reimburse Us for the lesser of:

    a) the amount of payment made or required to be made by Us; or

    b) the amount recovered from the Third Party less any reasonable legal fees associated with the recovery.


Third Party as used in this provision, means any person or legal entity whose act or omission, in full or in part, causes

You to suffer a Disability for which benefits are paid or payable under The Policy.


Legal Actions: When can legal action be taken against Us?

Legal action cannot be taken against Us:

    1) sooner than 60 days after the date Proof of Loss is given; or

    2) more than 3 years after the date Proof of Loss is required to be given according to the terms of The Policy.


Insurance Fraud: How does the Company deal with fraud?

Insurance Fraud occurs when You and/or Your Employer provide Us with false information or file a claim for benefits that

contains any false, incomplete or misleading information with the intent to injure, defraud or deceive Us. It is a crime if

You and/or Your Employer commit Insurance Fraud. We will use all means available to Us to detect, investigate, deter

and prosecute those who commit Insurance Fraud. We will pursue all available legal remedies if You and/or Your

Employer perpetrate Insurance Fraud.


Misstatements: What happens if facts are misstated?

If material facts about You were not stated accurately:

    1) Your premium may be adjusted; and

    2) the true facts will be used to determine if, and for what amount, coverage should have been in force.


No statement, except fraudulent misstatements, made by You relating to Your insurability will be used to contest the

insurance for which the statement was made after the insurance has been in force for two years during Your lifetime. In

order to be used, the statement must be in writing and signed by You.


All statements made by the Policyholder, the Employer or You under The Policy will be deemed representations and not

warranties. No statement made to affect this insurance will be used in any contest unless it is in writing and a copy of it is

given to the person who made it, or to his or her beneficiary or Your representative.


Eligibility Determination: How will We determine Your eligibility for benefits?

We, and not Your Employer or plan administrator, have the responsibility to fairly, thoroughly, objectively and timely

investigate, evaluate and determine Your eligibility or Your beneficiaries for benefits for any claim You or Your

beneficiaries make on The Policy. We will:

    1) obtain with Your cooperation and authorization if required by law, only such information that is necessary to

         evaluate Your claim and decide whether to accept or deny Your claim for benefits. We may obtain this

         information from Your Notice of Claim, submitted proofs of loss, statements, or other materials provided by You or

         others on Your behalf; or, at Our expense We may obtain necessary information, or have You physically

         examined when and as often as We may reasonably require while the claim is pending. In addition, and at Your

         option and at Your expense, You may provide Us and We will consider any other information, including but not

         limited to, reports from a Physician or other expert of Your choice. You should provide Us with all information that

         You want Us to consider regarding Your claim;

    2) consider and interpret The Policy and all information obtained by Us and submitted by You that relates to Your

         claim for benefits and make Our determination of Your eligibility for benefits based on that information and in

         accordance with The Policy and applicable law;

    3) if We approve Your claim, We will review Our decision to approve Your claim for benefits as often as is

         reasonably necessary to determine Your continued eligibility for benefits;

    4) if We deny Your claim, We will explain in writing to You or Your beneficiaries the basis for an adverse

         determination in accordance with The Policy as described in the provision entitled Claim Denial.

In the event We deny Your claim for benefits, in whole or in part, You can appeal the decision to Us. If You choose to

appeal Our decision, the process You must follow is set forth in The Policy provision entitled Claim Appeal. If You do not

appeal the decision to Us, then the decision will be Our final decision.


Physical Examinations and Autopsy: Will I be examined during the course of my claim?

While a claim is pending We have the right at Our expense:

    1) to have the person who has a loss examined by a Physician when and as often as reasonably necessary; and

    2) to make an autopsy in case of death where it is not forbidden by law.


                                                              28

                                                      DEFINITIONS

Actively at Work means at work with the Employer on a day that is one of the Employer's scheduled workdays. On that

day, You must be performing for wage or profit all of the regular duties of Your Occupation:

     1) in the usual way; and

     2) for Your usual number of hours.


We will consider You Actively at Work on a day that is not a scheduled work day only if You were Actively at Work on the

preceding scheduled work day.


Active Employee means an employee who works for the Employer on a regular basis in the usual course of the

Employer's business. This must be at least the number of hours shown in the Schedule of Insurance.


Any Occupation means any occupation for which You are qualified by education, training or experience, and that has an

earnings potential greater than the lesser of:

     1) the product of Your Indexed Pre-disability Earnings and the Benefit Percentage; or

     2) the Maximum Monthly Benefit.


Current Monthly Earnings means monthly earnings You receive from:

     1) Your Employer; and

     2) other employment;

while You are Disabled.


However, if the other employment is a job You held in addition to Your job with Your Employer, then during any period that

You are entitled to benefits for being Disabled from Your Occupation, only the portion of Your earnings that exceeds Your

average earnings from the other employer over the 6 month period just before You became Disabled will count as Current

Monthly Earnings.


Current Monthly Earnings also includes the pay You could have received for another job or a modified job if:

     1) such job was offered to You by Your Employer, or another employer, and You refused the offer; and

     2) the requirements of the position were consistent with:

         a) Your education, training and experience; and

         b) Your capabilities as medically substantiated by Your Physician.


Disability or Disabled means You are prevented from performing one or more of the Essential Duties of:

     1) Your Occupation during the Elimination Period;

     2) Your Occupation, for the 2 year(s) following the Elimination Period, and as a result Your Current Monthly Earnings

         are less than 80% of Your Indexed Pre-disability Earnings; and

     3) after that, Any Occupation.


If at the end of the Elimination Period, You are prevented from performing one or more of the Essential Duties of Your

Occupation, but Your Current Monthly Earnings are equal to or greater than 80% of Your Pre-disability Earnings, Your

Elimination Period will be extended for a total period of 12 months from the original date of Disability, or until such time as

Your Current Monthly Earnings are less than 80% of Your Pre-disability Earnings, whichever occurs first. For the

purposes of extending Your Elimination Period, Your Current Monthly Earnings will not include the pay You could have

received for another job or a modified job if such job was offered to You by Your Employer, or another employer, and You

refused the offer.


Your Disability must result from:

     1) accidental bodily injury;

     2) sickness;

     3) Mental Illness;

     4) Substance Abuse; or

     5) pregnancy.

Your failure to pass a physical examination required to maintain a license to perform the duties of Your Occupation, alone,

does not mean that You are Disabled.



                                                              29

Elimination Period means the longer of the number of consecutive days at the beginning of any one period of Disability

which must elapse before benefits are payable or the expiration of any Employer sponsored short term disability benefits

or salary continuation program, excluding benefits required by state law.


Employer means the Policyholder.


Essential Duty means a duty that:

    1) is substantial, not incidental;

    2) is fundamental or inherent to the occupation; and

    3) cannot be reasonably omitted or changed.

Your ability to work the number of hours in Your regularly scheduled workweek is an Essential Duty.


Indexed Pre-disability Earnings means Your Pre-disability Earnings adjusted annually by adding the lesser of:

    1) 10%; or

    2) the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index (CPI-W).


The percentage change in the CPI-W means the difference between the current year's CPI-W as of July 31, and the prior

year's CPI-W as of July 31, divided by the prior year's CPI-W. The adjustment is made January 1st each year after You

have been Disabled for 12 consecutive month(s), provided You are receiving benefits at the time the adjustment is made.


The term Consumer Price Index (CPI-W) means the index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers published by the

United States Department of Labor. It measures on a periodic (usually monthly) basis the change in the cost of typical

urban wage earners' and clerical workers' purchase of certain goods and services. If the index is discontinued or

changed, We may use another nationally published index that is comparable to the CPI-W.


Mental Illness means a mental disorder as listed in the current version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental

Disorders, published by the American Psychiatric Association. A Mental Illness may be caused by biological factors or

result in physical symptoms or manifestations.


For the purpose of The Policy, Mental Illness does not include the following mental disorders outlined in the Diagnostic

and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders:

         Employer;

    3) plan or arrangement of coverage, whether insured or not, which is received from Your Employer as a result of

         that You, Your spouse and/or children, are eligible to receive because of Your Disability; or

                                                              30

     6) disability benefit from the Department of Veterans Affairs, or any other foreign or domestic governmental agency:

        a) that begins after You become Disabled; or

        b) that You were receiving before becoming Disabled, but only as to the amount of any increase in the benefit

             attributed to Your Disability.

        that You, Your spouse and/or children receive because of Your retirement, unless You were receiving them prior

        to becoming Disabled.


If You are paid Other Income Benefits in a lump sum or settlement, You must provide proof satisfactory to Us of:

     1) the amount attributed to loss of income; and

     2) the period of time covered by the lump sum or settlement.

       insurance policies issued in Illinois.


                                                      STATE OF ILLINOIS

                                   The Religious Freedom Protection and Civil Union Act

                                                     Effective June 1, 2011


       The Religious Freedom Protection and Civil Union Act ("the Act") creates a legal relationship between two

       persons of the same or opposite sex who form a civil union. The Act provides that the parties to a civil

       union are entitled to the same legal obligations, responsibilities, protections and benefits that are afforded

       or recognized by the laws of Illinois to spouses. The law further provides that a party to a civil union shall

       be included in any definition or use of the terms "spouse," "family," "immediate family," "dependent," "next

       of kin," and other terms descriptive of spousal relationships as those terms are used throughout Illinois

       law. This includes the terms "marriage" or "married," or variations thereon. Insurance policies are required

       to provide identical benefits and protections to both civil unions and marriages. If policies of insurance

       provide coverage for children, the children of civil unions must also be provided coverage. The Act also

       requires recognition of civil unions or same sex civil unions or marriages legally entered into in other

       jurisdictions.


       For more information regarding the Act, refer to 750 ILCS 75/1 et seq. Examples of the interaction

       between the Act and existing law can be found in the Illinois Insurance Facts, Civil Unions and Insurance

       Benefits    document      available    on   the    Illinois  Department      of  Insurance's     website    at

If You do not enroll for Your coverage and/or Your Dependent's coverage within 31 days after becoming eligible under

enroll for Your coverage and/or Your Dependent's coverage only:

    1) during an Annual Enrollment Period designated by the Policyholder; or

    2) within 31 days of the date You have a Change in Family Status.


Enrollment may be subject to the Evidence of Insurability Requirements provision.


Evidence of Insurability Requirements: When will I first be required to provide Evidence of Insurability?

We require Evidence of Insurability for initial coverage, if You:

    1) enroll more than 31 days after the date You are first eligible to enroll, including electing initial coverage after a

         Change in Family Status;

    3) were eligible for any coverage under the Prior Policy, but did not enroll and later choose to enroll for that coverage

         under The Policy.


If Your Evidence of Insurability is not satisfactory to Us:

    1) Your Amount of Life Insurance will equal the amount for which You were eligible without providing Evidence of

         Insurability, provided You enrolled within 31 days of the date You were first eligible to enroll; and

    2) You will not be covered under The Policy if You enrolled more than 31 days after the date You were first eligible

         to enroll.


Dependent Evidence of Insurability Requirements: When will my Dependents first be required to provide Evidence of

Insurability?

We require Evidence of Insurability, satisfactory to Us, for initial coverage, if You:

    1) enroll for Your Dependents' coverage more than 31 days after the date You are first eligible to enroll, including

         electing initial coverage after a Change in Family Status;

    2) enroll for an Amount of Dependent Life Insurance greater than the Supplemental Dependent Guaranteed Issue

         Amount, regardless of when You enroll for coverage; or

    3) were eligible for any coverage under the Prior Policy, but did not enroll and later choose to enroll for that coverage

         under The Policy.


However, no Evidence of Insurability will be required if the Amount of Life Insurance for Your Dependent Child(ren) is

$15,000 or less.


If Your Dependents' Evidence of Insurability is not satisfactory to Us:

    1) Your Dependents' Amount of Life Insurance will equal the amount for which Your Dependents were eligible

         without providing Evidence of Insurability, provided You enrolled Your Dependents within 31 days of the date You

         were first eligible to enroll;

    2) Your Dependents will not be covered under The Policy if You enrolled Your Dependents more than 31 days after

         the date You were first eligible to enroll.


Evidence of Insurability: What is Evidence of Insurability?

Evidence of Insurability must be satisfactory to Us and may include, but will not be limited to:

Increase in Amount of Life Insurance provision.

                                               PERIOD OF COVERAGE

Effective Date: When does my coverage start?

Non-Contributory Coverage will start on the date You become eligible.


Contributory Coverage, for which Evidence of Insurability is not required, will start on the latest to occur of:

     1) the date You become eligible, if You enroll on or before that date;

     2) the first day of the month on or next following the last day of the Annual Enrollment Period, if You enroll during an

         Annual Enrollment Period; or

     3) the date You enroll, if You do so within 31 days from the date You are eligible.


Any coverage for which Evidence of Insurability is required, will become effective on the later of:

     1) the date You become eligible; or

     2) the date We approve Your Evidence of Insurability.


All Effective Dates of coverage are subject to the Deferred Effective Date provision.


Deferred Effective Date: When will my effective date for coverage or a change in my coverage be deferred?

If, on the date You are to become covered:

     1) under The Policy;

     2) for increased benefits; or

     3) for a new benefit;

You are not Actively at Work due to a physical or mental condition, such coverage will not start until the date You are

Actively at Work.


Continuity from a Prior Policy: Is there continuity of coverage from a Prior Policy?

Your initial coverage under The Policy will begin, and will not be deferred if, on the day before the Policy Effective Date,

You were insured under the Prior Policy, but on the Policy Effective Date, You were not Actively at Work, and would

otherwise meet the Eligibility requirements of The Policy. However, Your Amount of Insurance will be the lesser of the

amount of life insurance and accidental death and dismemberment principal sum:

     1) You had under the Prior Policy; or

     2) shown in the Schedule of Insurance;

reduced by any coverage amount:

     1) that is in force, paid or payable under the Prior Policy; or

     2) that would have been so payable under the Prior Policy had timely election been made.


Such amount of insurance under this provision is subject to any reductions in The Policy and will not increase.


Coverage provided through this provision ends on the first to occur of:

     1) the last day of a period of 12 consecutive months after the Policy Effective Date;

     2) the date Your insurance terminates for any reason shown under the Termination provision;

     3) the last day You would have been covered under the Prior Policy, had the Prior Policy not terminated; or

     4) the date You are Actively at Work.

However, if the coverage provided through this provision ends because You are Actively at Work, You may be covered as

an Active Employee under The Policy.


Dependent Effective Date: When does Dependent coverage start?

Coverage, for which Evidence of Insurability is not required, will start on the latest to occur of:

     1) the date You become eligible for Dependent coverage, if You have enrolled on or before that date; or

     2) the first day of the month on or next following the last day of the Annual Enrollment Period, if You enroll during an

         Annual Enrollment Period; or

     3) the date You enroll, if You do so within 31 days from the date You are eligible for Dependent coverage.

                                                              50

Coverage for which Evidence of Insurability is required, will become effective on the later of:

     1) the date You become eligible for Dependent coverage; or

     2) the date We approve Your Dependents' Evidence of Insurability.


In no event will Dependent coverage become effective before You become insured.


Dependent Deferred Effective Date: When will the effective date for Dependent coverage or a change in coverage be

deferred?

If, on the date Your Dependent, other than a newborn, is to become covered:

     1) under The Policy;

     2) for increased benefits; or

     3) for a new benefit; and

he or she is:

     1) confined in a hospital; or

     2) Confined Elsewhere;

such coverage will not start until he or she:

     1) is discharged from the hospital; or

     2) is no longer Confined Elsewhere;

and has engaged in all the normal and customary activities of a person of like age and gender, in good health, for at least

15 consecutive days.


This Deferred Effective Date provision will not apply to disabled children who qualify under the definition of Dependent

Child(ren).


Confined Elsewhere means Your Dependent is unable to perform, unaided, the normal functions of daily living, or leave

home or other place of residence without assistance.


Dependent Continuity from a Prior Policy: Is there continuity of coverage from a Prior Policy for my Dependents?

If on the day before the Policy Effective Date, You were covered with respect to Your Dependents under the Prior Policy,

the Deferred Effective Date provision will not apply to initial coverage under The Policy for such Dependents. However,

the Dependent Amount of Insurance will be the lesser of the amount of life insurance and the accidental death and

dismemberment principal sum:

     1) Your Dependents had under the Prior Policy; or

     2) shown in the Schedule of Insurance;

reduced by any coverage amount:

     1) that is in force, paid or payable under the Prior Policy; or

     2) that would have been so payable under the Prior Policy had timely election been made.


Change in Coverage: When may I change my coverage or coverage for my Dependents?

After Your initial enrollment You may increase or decrease coverage for You or Your Dependents, or add a new

Dependent to Your existing Dependent coverage:

     1) during any Annual Enrollment Period designated by the Policyholder; or

     2) within 31 days of the date of a Change in Family Status.


Effective Date for Changes in Coverage: When will changes in coverage become effective?

Any decrease in coverage will take effect on the date of the change.


Any increase in coverage will take effect on the latest of:

     1) the date of the change;

     2) the date requirements of the Deferred Effective Date provision are met;

     3) the date Evidence of Insurability is approved, if required; or

     4) the first day of the month on or next following the last day of the Annual Enrollment Period, except for an increase

         as a result of a Change in Family Status.


Increase in Amount of Life Insurance: If I request an increase in the Amount of Life Insurance for myself or my

Dependents, must we provide Evidence of Insurability?

If You or Your Dependents are:

     1) already enrolled for an Amount of Supplemental Life Insurance under The Policy, then You and Your Dependents

         must provide Evidence of Insurability for an increase of more than one level; or

                                                                51

    2) not already enrolled for an Amount of Supplemental Life Insurance under The Policy, You and Your Dependents

        must provide Evidence of Insurability for any amount of Supplemental Life Insurance coverage including an initial

        amount.


In any event, if the Amount of Life Insurance You request is greater than the Guaranteed Issue Amount, You or Your

Dependents, as applicable, must provide Evidence of Insurability.


If Your Evidence of Insurability is not satisfactory to Us, the Amount of Life Insurance You had in effect on the date

immediately prior to the date You requested the increase will not change.


If Your Dependents' Evidence of Insurability is not satisfactory to Us, the Amount of Life Insurance he or she had in effect

on the date immediately prior to the date You requested the increase will not change.


Increase in Amount of Life Insurance: If my Amount of Life Insurance increases because my Earnings increase, must I

provide Evidence of Insurability?

If Your Amount of Life Insurance is based on a multiple of Your Earnings, You must provide Evidence of Insurability if

Your Earnings increase such that Your Amount of Life Insurance is greater than the Guaranteed Issue Amount. An

increase in Earnings which causes an increase in Your Amount of Life Insurance will be accompanied by a corresponding

increase in the amount of premium due for this coverage.


Once approved, We will not require Evidence of Insurability again if Your Amount of Life Insurance increases solely

because Your Earnings increased.


However, if:

    1) You do not submit Evidence of Insurability; or

    2) Your Evidence of Insurability is not satisfactory to Us,

Your Amount of Life Insurance:

    1) will increase, but only up to the amount for which You were eligible without having to provide Evidence of

        Insurability; and

    2) will not increase again, or beyond that amount, until Your Evidence of Insurability is approved.


Termination: When will my coverage end?

Your coverage will end on the earliest of the following:

    1) the date The Policy terminates;

    2) the date You are no longer in a class eligible for coverage, or The Policy no longer insures Your class;

    3) the date the premium payment is due but not paid;

    4) the date Your Employer terminates Your employment; or

    5) the date You are no longer Actively at Work;

unless continued in accordance with any one of the Continuation Provisions.


Dependent Termination: When does coverage for my Dependent end?

Coverage for Your Dependent will end on the earliest to occur of:

    1) the date Your coverage ends;

    2) the date the required premium is due but not paid;

    3) the date You are no longer eligible for Dependent coverage;

    4) the date We or the Employer terminate Dependent coverage; or

    5) the date the Dependent no longer meets the definition of Dependent;

unless continued in accordance with the Continuation Provisions.


Continuation Provisions: Can my coverage and coverage for my Dependents be continued beyond the date it would

otherwise terminate?

Coverage can be continued by Your Employer beyond a date shown in the Termination provision, if Your Employer

provides a plan of continuation which applies to all employees the same way.


The amount of continued coverage applicable to You or Your Dependents will be the amount of coverage in effect on the

date immediately before coverage would otherwise have ended. Continued coverage:

    1) is subject to any reductions in The Policy;

    2) is subject to payment of premium;

    3) may be continued up to the maximum time shown in the provisions; and

    4) terminates if The Policy terminates.

                                                                52

In no event will the amount of insurance increase while coverage is continued in accordance with the following provisions.

The Continuation Provisions shown below may not be applied consecutively.


In all other respects, the terms of Your coverage and coverage for Your Dependents remain unchanged.


Leave of Absence: If You are on a documented medical leave of absence, other than Family and Medical Leave or

Military Leave of Absence, Your coverage (including Dependent Life coverage) may be continued for 9 month(s) after the

date the leave of absence commenced. If the leave terminates prior to the agreed upon date, this continuation will cease

immediately.


Military Leave of Absence: If You enter active full-time military service and are granted a military leave of absence in

writing, Your coverage (including Dependent Life coverage) may be continued for up to 12 weeks. If the leave ends prior

to the agreed upon date, this continuation will cease immediately.


Lay Off: If You are temporarily laid off by the Employer due to lack of work, all of Your coverage (including Dependent

Life coverage) may be continued until the last day of the month following the month in which the lay off commenced. If

Disability Insurance: If You are working for the Policyholder and:

     1) are covered by; and

     2) meet the definition of disabled under;

are:

     1) age 26 or older; and

     2) disabled; and

     3) primarily dependent upon You for financial support;

then Dependent Child(ren) coverage will not terminate solely due to age. However:

     1) You must submit proof satisfactory to Us of such Dependent Child(ren)'s disability within 31 days of the date he or

         she reaches such age; and

    3) any required premium is paid when due.

However, no increase in the Amount of Life Insurance for such Dependent Child(ren) will be available.

the child continues to meet these conditions. We will not require proof more often than once a year after that.

person was:

      1) a passenger riding in; or

      2) the licensed operator of;

This Benefit will be paid:

      1) after We receive Proof of Loss, in accordance with the Proof of Loss provision; and

      2) according to the General Provisions of The Policy.


If a Seat Belt Benefit is payable, We will also pay an Air Bag Benefit if the injured person was:

         Percentage; or

      2) the Maximum Amount for this Benefit.

The specific amounts for this Benefit are shown in the Schedule of Insurance.


Repatriation Benefit: When is the Repatriation Benefit payable?

If You or Your Dependents sustain an Injury that results in Loss of life payable under the Accidental Death and

Dismemberment Benefit, We will pay an additional Repatriation Benefit, if the death occurs outside the territorial limits of

the state or country of the deceased person's place of permanent residence. We will only pay a benefit if the deceased

person's body is transported across state lines or country borders.


This Benefit will be paid:

The Repatriation Benefit will pay the least of:

         a) preparation of the body for burial or cremation; and

         b) transportation of the body to the place of burial or cremation;

     2) the amount resulting from multiplying the deceased person's amount of Principal Sum by the Repatriation Benefit

         Percentage; or

     3) the Maximum Amount for this Benefit.


The specific amounts for this Benefit are shown in the Schedule of Insurance.


Accelerated Benefit: What is the benefit?

In the event that You or Your Dependent are diagnosed as Terminally Ill while the Terminally Ill person is:

     1) covered under The Policy for an Amount of Life Insurance of at least $10,000; and

     2) under age 60;

We will pay the Accelerated Benefit in a lump sum amount as shown below, provided We receive proof of such Terminal

Illness.


The Accelerated Benefit will not be available to You unless You have been Actively at Work under The Policy.


You must request in writing that a portion of the Terminally Ill person's Amount of Life Insurance be paid as an

Accelerated Benefit.


The Amount of Life Insurance payable upon the Terminally Ill person's death will be reduced by any Accelerated Benefit

Amount paid under this benefit. In addition, Your remaining Amount of Life Insurance will be subject to any reductions in

The Policy and will not increase once an Accelerated Benefit has been paid. Any premium required will be based on the

amount of Your life insurance remaining after the Accelerated Benefit is paid under this benefit. There will be no effect on

the Accidental Death and Dismemberment Benefit Principal Sum after the Accelerated Benefit Amount is paid under this

benefit.


You may request a minimum Accelerated Benefit amount of $3,000, and a maximum of $500,000. However, in no event

will the Accelerated Benefit Amount exceed 80% of the Terminally Ill person's Amount of Life Insurance. This option may

be exercised only once for You and only once for each of Your Dependents.


For example, if You are covered for a Life Insurance Benefit Amount under The Policy of $100,000 and are Terminally Ill,

You can request any portion of the Amount of Life Insurance Benefits from $3,000 to $80,000 to be paid now instead of to

Your beneficiary upon death. However, if You decide to request only $3,000 now, You cannot request the additional

$77,000 in the future.


A person who submits proof satisfactory to Us of his or her Terminal Illness will also meet the definition of Disabled for

Waiver of Premium.


Any benefits received under this benefit may be taxable. You should consult a personal tax advisor for further

information.


In the event:

     1) You are required by law to accelerate benefits to meet the claims of creditors; or

     2) if a government agency requires You to apply for benefits to qualify for a government benefit or entitlement;

                                                              58

You will still be required to satisfy all the terms and conditions herein in order to receive an Accelerated Benefit.


If You have executed an assignment of rights and interest with respect to Your or Your Dependent's Amount of Life

Insurance, in order to receive the Accelerated Benefit, We must receive a release from the assignee before any benefits

are payable.


Terminal Illness or Terminally Ill means a life expectancy of 6 months or less.


Proof of Terminal Illness and Examinations: Must proof of Terminal Illness be submitted?

We reserve the right to require satisfactory Proof of Terminal Illness on an ongoing basis. Any diagnosis submitted must

be provided by a Physician.


If You or Your Dependents do not submit proof of Terminal Illness satisfactory to Us, or if You or Your Dependents refuse

to be examined by a Physician, as We may require, then We will not pay an Accelerated Benefit.


Conversion Right: If coverage under The Policy ends, do I have a right to convert?

If Life Insurance coverage or any portion of it under The Policy ends for any reason, except nonpayment of premium, You

and Your Dependents may have the right to convert the coverage that terminated to an individual conversion policy

without providing Evidence of Insurability. Conversion is not available for:

     1) the Accidental Death and Dismemberment Benefits; or

     2) any Amount of Life Insurance for which You or Your Dependents were not eligible and covered;

under The Policy.


If coverage under The Policy ends because:

     1) The Policy is terminated; or,

     2) coverage for an Eligible Class is terminated;

then You or Your Dependent must have been insured under The Policy for 5 years or more, in order to be eligible to

convert coverage. The amount which may be converted under these circumstances is limited to the lesser of:

     1) $10,000; or

     2) the Life Insurance Benefit under The Policy less any Amount of Life Insurance for which You or Your Dependent

          may become eligible under any group life insurance policy issued or reinstated within 31 days of termination of

          group life coverage.


If coverage under The Policy ends for any other reason, except nonpayment of premium, the full amount of coverage

which ended may be converted.


Insurer, as used in this provision, means Us or another insurance company which has agreed to issue conversion

policies according to this Conversion Right.


Conversion: How do I convert my coverage or my Dependents' coverage?

To convert Your coverage or coverage for Your Dependents, You must:

     1) complete a Notice of Conversion Right form; and

     2) have Your Employer sign the form.

The Insurer must receive this within:

     1) 31 days after Life Insurance terminates; or

     2) 15 days from the date Your Employer signs the form;

whichever is later. However, We will not accept requests for Conversion if they are received more than 91 days after Life

Insurance terminates.


After the Insurer verifies eligibility for coverage, the Insurer will send You a Conversion Policy proposal. You must:

     1) complete and return the request form in the proposal; and

     2) pay the required premium for coverage;

within the time period specified in the proposal.


Any individual policy issued to You or Your Dependents under the Conversion Right:

     1) will be effective as of the 32nd day after the date coverage ends; and

     2) will be in lieu of coverage for this amount under The Policy.


Conversion Policy Provisions: What are the Conversion Policy provisions?

The Conversion Policy will:

                                                                 59

     1) be issued on any one of the Life Insurance policy forms the Insurer is issuing for this purpose at the time of

        conversion; and

     2) base premiums on the Insurer's rates in effect for new applicants of Your class and age at the time of conversion.

The Conversion Policy will not provide:

     1) the same terms and conditions of coverage as The Policy;

     2) any benefit other than the Life Insurance Benefit; and

     3) term insurance.


However, Conversion is not available for any Amount of Life Insurance which was, or is being, continued:

     1) in accordance with the Waiver of Premium provision;

     2) under a certificate of insurance issued in accordance with the Portability provision; or

     3) in accordance with the Continuation Provisions;

until such coverage ends.


Death within the Conversion Period: What if I or my Dependents die before coverage is converted?

We will pay the deceased person's Amount of Life Insurance You would have had the right to apply for under this

provision if:

     1) coverage under The Policy terminates; and

     2) You or Your Dependent die within 31 days of the date coverage terminates; and

     3) We receive Proof of Loss.


If the Conversion Policy has already taken effect, no Life Insurance Benefit will be payable under The Policy for the

amount converted.


Effect of Waiver of Premium on Conversion: What happens to the Conversion Policy if Waiver of Premium is later

approved?

If You apply and are approved for Waiver of Premium after an individual Conversion Policy has been issued, any benefit

payable at Your or Your Dependent's death under The Policy will be paid only if the individual Conversion Policy is

surrendered. The Insurer will refund the premium paid for such Conversion Policy.


Portability Benefits: What is Portability?

Portability is a provision which allows You and Your Dependents to continue coverage under a group Portability policy

when coverage would otherwise end due to certain Qualifying Events. Portability applies to Basic Life Insurance,

Supplemental Life Insurance and Supplemental Dependent Life Insurance coverages only.


Qualifying Events: What are Qualifying Events?

Qualifying Events for You are:

     1) Your employment terminates for any reason prior to Normal Retirement Age; or

     2) Your membership in an Eligible Class under The Policy ends;

     provided the Qualifying Event occurs prior to Normal Retirement Age.


Qualifying Events for Your Dependents are:

     1) Your employment terminates, for any reason prior to Normal Retirement Age;

     2) Your death;

     3) Your membership in a class eligible for Dependent coverage ends; or

     4) He or she no longer meets the definition of Dependent, however, a Dependent Child(ren) who reaches the

        limiting age under The Policy is not eligible for Portability;

     provided the Qualifying Event occurs prior to Normal Retirement Age.


In order for Dependent Child(ren) coverage to be continued under this provision, You or Your Spouse must elect to

continue coverage due to your own Qualifying Event.


Electing Portability: How do I elect Portability?

You may elect Portability for Your coverage after Your Basic and Supplemental Life Insurance coverage ends due to a

Qualifying Event. You may also elect Portability for Your Dependent coverage if Your Dependent coverage ends due to a

Qualifying Event. The Policy must still be in force in order for Portability to be available.


To elect Portability for You or Your Dependents, You must:

     1) complete and have Your Employer sign a Portability application; and

     2) submit the application to Us, with the required premium.

                                                              60

This must be received within:

     1) 31 days after Life Insurance terminates; or

     2) 15 days from the date Your Employer signs the application;

whichever is later. However, Portability requests will not be accepted if they are received more than 91 days after Life

Insurance terminates.


After We verify eligibility for coverage, We will issue a certificate of insurance under a Portability policy. The Portability

coverage will be:

     1) issued without Evidence of Insurability;

     2) issued on one of the forms then being issued by Us for Portability purposes; and

     3) effective on the day following the date Your or Your Dependent's coverage ends.

The terms and conditions of coverage under the Portability policy will not be the same terms and conditions that are

applicable to coverage under The Policy.


Limitations: What limitations apply to this benefit?

You may elect to continue 50%, 75%, or 100% of the Amount of Life Insurance which is ending for You or Your

Dependent. This amount will be rounded to the next higher multiple of $1,000, if not already a multiple of $1,000.

However, the Amount of Life Insurance that may be continued will not exceed:

     1) $250,000 for You;

     2) $50,000 for Your Spouse; or

     3) $10,000 for Your Dependent Child(ren).


If You elect to continue 50% or 75% now, You may not continue any portion of the remaining amount under this Portability

provision at a later date. In no event will You or Your Dependents be able to continue an Amount of Life Insurance which

is less than $5,000.


Portability is not available for any Amount of Life Insurance for which You or Your Dependents were not eligible and

covered.


In addition Portability is not available if You or Your Dependents are entering active military service.


Effect of Portability on Other Provisions: How does Portability affect other Provisions?

Portability is not available for any Amount of Life Insurance that You have exercised under the Conversion Right or that

You have been approved for under the Waiver of Premium provision. Portability is also not available to You while Your

coverage is being continued under a Continuation Provision under The Policy. However, if:

     1) You elect to continue only a portion of terminated coverage under this Portability Benefit; or

     2) the Amount of Life Insurance exceeds the maximum Portability amount;

then the Conversion Right may be available for the remaining amount.


The Waiver of Premium provision will not be available if You elect to continue coverage under this Portability Benefit.

When We determine that benefits are payable, We will pay the benefits in accordance with the Claims to be Paid

provision, but not more than 30 days after such Proof of Loss is received.

person who at Our option and in Our opinion is providing financial support and maintenance for the minor. We will pay:

     1) $200 at Your death; and

sum payment or may elect to receive benefits through a draft book account. The draft book account will be owned by:

     1) You, if living; or

You may designate or change a beneficiary by doing so in writing on a form satisfactory to Us and filing the form with the

Employer. Only satisfactory forms sent to the Employer prior to Your death will be accepted.


Beneficiary designations will become effective as of the date You signed and dated the form, even if You have since died.

     1) must request a review upon written application within:

         a) 180 days of receipt of claim denial if the claim requires Us to make a determination of disability; or

         b) 60 days of receipt of claim denial if the claim does not require Us to make a determination of disability; and

     2) may request copies of all documents, records, and other information relevant to the claim; and

                                                               63

     3) may submit written comments, documents, records and other information relating to the claim.


We will respond in writing with Our final decision on the claim.


Eligibility Determination: How will We determine Your or Your Dependent's eligibility for benefits?

We, and not Your Employer or plan administrator, have the responsibility to fairly, thoroughly, objectively and timely

investigate, evaluate and determine Your or Your Dependent's eligibility for benefits for any claim You or Your

beneficiaries make on The Policy. We will:

     1) obtain with Your or Your beneficiaries' cooperation and authorization if required by law, only such information that

         is necessary to evaluate Your or Your beneficiaries' claim and decide whether to accept or deny Your or Your

         beneficiaries' claim for benefits. We may obtain this information from Your or Your beneficiaries' Notice of Claim,

         submitted proofs of loss, statements, or other materials provided by You or others on Your behalf; or, at Our

         expense We may obtain necessary information, or have You or Your Dependent's physically examined when and

         as often as We may reasonably require while the claim is pending. In addition, and at Your or Your beneficiaries'

         option and at Your or Your beneficiaries' expense, You or Your beneficiaries may provide Us and We will consider

         any other information, including but not limited to, reports from a Physician or other expert of Your or Your

         beneficiaries' choice. You or Your beneficiaries should provide Us with all information that You or Your

         beneficiaries want Us to consider regarding Your or Your beneficiaries' claim;

     2) consider and interpret The Policy and all information obtained by Us and submitted by You or Your beneficiaries

         that relates to Your or Your beneficiaries' claim for benefits and make Our determination of Your or Your

         Dependent's eligibility for benefits based on that information and in accordance with The Policy and applicable

         law;

     3) if We approve Your claim, We will review Our decision to approve Your or Your beneficiaries claim for benefits as

         often as is reasonably necessary to determine Your or Your Dependent's continued eligibility for benefits;

     4) if We deny Your or Your beneficiaries' claim, We will explain in writing to You or Your beneficiaries the basis for

         an adverse determination in accordance with The Policy as described in the provision entitled Claim Denial.

In the event We deny Your or Your beneficiaries' claim for benefits, in whole or in part, You or Your beneficiaries can

appeal the decision to Us. If You or Your beneficiaries choose to appeal Our decision, the process You or Your
beneficiaries must follow is set forth in The Policy provision entitled Claim Appeal. If You or Your beneficiaries do not

appeal the decision to Us, then the decision will be Our final decision.


Incontestability: When can the Life Insurance Benefit of The Policy be contested?

Except for non-payment of premiums, Your or Your Dependent's Life Insurance Benefit cannot be contested after two

years from its effective date.


In the absence of fraud, no statement made by You or Your Spouse relating to Your or Your Spouse's insurability will be

used to contest Your insurance for which the statement was made after Your insurance has been in force for two years.

In order to be used, the statement must be in writing and signed by You and Your Spouse.


No statement made relating to Your Dependents being insurable will be used to contest their insurance for which the

statement was made after their insurance has been in force for two years. In order to be used, the statement must be in

writing and signed by You or Your representative.


All statements made by the Policyholder, the Employer or You or Your Spouse under The Policy will be deemed

representations and not warranties. No statement made to affect this insurance will be used in any contest unless it is in

writing and a copy of it is given to the person who made it, or to his or her beneficiary or Your representative.


Assignment: Are there any rights of assignment?

Except for the dismemberment benefits under the Accidental Death and Dismemberment Benefit, You have the right to

absolutely assign all of Your rights and interest under The Policy including, but not limited to the following:

     1) the right to make any contributions required to keep the insurance in force;

Insurance fraud occurs when You, Your Dependents and/or the Employer provide Us with false information or file a claim

for benefits that contains any false, incomplete or misleading information with the intent to injure, defraud or deceive Us.

It is a crime if You, Your Dependents and/or the Employer commit insurance fraud. We will use all means available to Us

to detect, investigate, deter and prosecute those who commit insurance fraud. We will pursue all available legal remedies

if You, Your Dependents and/or the Employer perpetrate insurance fraud.


Misstatements: What happens if facts are misstated?

If material facts about You or Your Dependents were not stated accurately:

     1) the premium may be adjusted; and

     2) the true facts will be used to determine if, and for what amount, coverage should have been in force.

                                         CONTAINS IMPORTANT INFORMATION


This employee welfare benefit plan (Plan) is subject to certain requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security

Act of 1974 (ERISA), as amended. ERISA requires that you receive a Statement of ERISA Rights, a description of Claim

Procedures, and other specific information about the Plan. This document serves to meet ERISA requirements and

provides important information about the Plan.


The benefits described in your booklet-certificate (Booklet) are provided under a group insurance policy (Policy) issued by

the Hartford Life and Accident Insurance Company (Insurance Company) and are subject to the Policy's terms and

conditions. The Policy is incorporated into, and forms a part of, the Plan. The Plan has designated and named the

Insurance Company as the claims fiduciary for benefits provided under the Policy. The Plan has granted the Insurance

Company full discretion and authority to determine eligibility for benefits and to construe and interpret all terms and

provisions of the Policy.


A copy of the Plan is available for your review during normal working hours in the office of the Plan Administrator.

8. Sources of Contributions (Long Term Disability) The Employer pays the premium for the insurance, but may

    allocate part of the cost to the employee, or the employee may pay the entire premium. The Employer determines the

    portion of the cost to be paid by the employee. The insurance company/provider determines the cost according to the

    rate structure reflected in the Policy of Incorporation. Any amounts paid by employees may be used to pay any

    benefit or expense under the plan.


    Sources of Contributions (Life and Accidental Death and Dismemberment) Basic and supplemental coverage

    are being offered under a single ERISA plan. The Employer may pay some or all of the premium for the basic

    coverage. Coverages described in the certificate/policy as noncontributory or as being paid by the Employer, if any,

    are those paid for directly by the Employer such that you may have no direct out of pocket expense for such

    coverage. However, employees who elect supplemental coverage will be required to contribute specified amounts to

    the plan. Any amounts paid by employees may be used to pay any benefit or expense under the plan.



9. Type of Administration The plan is administered by the Plan Administrator with benefits provided in accordance

    with the provisions of the applicable group plan.



10. The Plan and its records are kept on a Policy Year basis.



11. Labor Organizations


    None



12. Names and Addresses of Trustees

13. Plan Amendment Procedure


    The Plan Administrator reserves full authority, at its sole discretion, to terminate, suspend, withdraw, reduce, amend

    or modify the Plan, in whole or in part, at any time, without prior notice.


    The Employer also reserves the right to adjust your share of the cost to continue coverage by the same procedures.


                                                               69

STATEMENT OF ERISA RIGHTS


As a participant in the Plan you are entitled to certain rights and protections under the Employee Retirement Income

Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), as amended. ERISA provides that all Plan participants shall be entitled to:


1. Receive Information About Your Plan and Benefits


    a) Examine, without charge, at the Plan Administrator's office and at other specified locations, such as worksites and

         union halls, all documents governing the Plan, including insurance contracts and collective bargaining

         agreements, and a copy of the latest annual report (Form 5500 Series) filed by the Plan with the U.S. Department

         of Labor and available at the Public Disclosure Room of the Employee Benefits Security Administration.

    b) Obtain, upon written request to the Plan Administrator, copies of documents governing the operation of the Plan,

         including insurance contracts and collective bargaining agreements, and copies of the latest annual report (Form

         5500 Series) and updated summary Plan description. The administrator may make a reasonable charge for the

         copies.

    c) Receive a summary of the Plan's annual financial report. The Plan Administrator is required by law to furnish

         each participant with a copy of this summary annual report.


2. Prudent Actions by Plan Fiduciaries


In addition to creating rights for Plan participants ERISA imposes duties upon the people who are responsible for the

operation of the employee benefit Plan. The people who operate your Plan, called "fiduciaries" of the Plan, have a duty to

do so prudently and in the interest of you and other Plan participants and beneficiaries. No one, including your employer,

your union, or any other person, may fire you or otherwise discriminate against you in any way to prevent you from

obtaining a welfare benefit or exercising your rights under ERISA.


3. Enforce Your Rights


If your claim for a welfare benefit is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you have a right to know why this was done, to

obtain copies of documents relating to the decision without charge, and to appeal any denial, all within certain time

schedules. Under ERISA, there are steps you can take to enforce the above rights. For instance, if you request a copy of

Plan documents or the latest annual report from the Plan and do not receive them within 30 days, you may file suit in a

Federal court. In such a case, the court may require the Plan Administrator to provide the materials and pay you up to

$110 a day until you receive the materials, unless the materials were not sent because of reasons beyond the control of

the administrator. If you have a claim for benefits which is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you may file suit in a

state or Federal court. If the Plan requires you to complete administrative appeals prior to filing in court, your right to file

suit in state or Federal court may be affected if you do not complete the required appeals. If it should happen that Plan

fiduciaries misuse the Plan's money, or if you are discriminated against for asserting your rights, you may seek assistance

from the U.S. Department of Labor, or you may file suit in a Federal court. The court will decide who should pay court

costs and legal fees. If you are successful the court may order the person you have sued to pay these costs and fees. If

you lose, the court may order you to pay these costs and fees, for example, if it finds your claim is frivolous.


4. Assistance with Your Questions


If you have any questions about your Plan, you should contact the Plan Administrator. If you have any questions about

this statement or about your rights under ERISA, or if you need assistance in obtaining documents from the Plan

Administrator, you should contact the nearest office of the Employee Benefits Security Administration (formerly known as

the Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration), U.S. Department of Labor, listed in your telephone directory or the

Division of Technical Assistance and Inquiries, Employee Benefits Security Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, 200

Constitution Avenue N.W., Washington, D.C. 20210. You may also obtain certain publications about your rights and

responsibilities under ERISA by calling the publications hotline of the Employee Benefits Security Administration.



CLAIM PROCEDURES


The Plan has designated and named the Insurance Company as the claims fiduciary for benefits provided under the

Policy. The Plan has granted the Insurance Company full discretion and authority to determine eligibility for benefits and

to construe and interpret all terms and provisions of the Policy.

                                                                71

Claims for Benefits


If you or your authorized representative would like to file a claim for benefits for yourself or your insured dependents, you

or your authorized representative should obtain a claim form(s) from your Employer or Plan Administrator. The applicable

section of such form(s) must be completed by (1) you, (2) the Employer or Plan Administrator and (3) the attending

physician or hospital. Following completion, the claim form(s) must be forwarded to the Insurance Company's claim

representative. The Insurance Company will evaluate your claim and determine if benefits are payable.


The Insurance Company will make a decision no more than 45 days after receipt of your properly filed claim. The time for

decision may be extended for two additional 30 day periods provided that, prior to any extension period, the Insurance

Company notifies you in writing that an extension is necessary due to matters beyond the control of the Plan, identifies

those matters and gives the date by which it expects to render its decision. If your claim is extended due to your failure to

submit information necessary to decide your claim, the time for decision may be tolled from the date on which the

notification of the extension is sent to you until the date we receive your response to our request. If the Insurance

Company approves your claim, the decision will contain information sufficient to reasonably inform you of that decision.


Any adverse benefit determination will be in writing and include: 1) specific reasons for the decision, 2) specific

references to the Policy provisions on which the decision is based, 3) a description of any additional material or

information necessary for you to perfect the claim and an explanation of why such material or information is necessary, 4)

a description of the review procedures and time limits applicable to such procedures, 5) a statement that you have the

right to bring a civil action under section 502(a) of ERISA after you appeal our decision and after you receive a written

denial on appeal, and 6) (A) if an internal rule, guideline, protocol, or other similar criterion was relied upon in making the

denial, either (i) the specific rule, guideline, protocol or other similar criterion, or (ii) a statement that such a rule, guideline,

protocol or other similar criterion was relied upon in making the denial and that a copy will be provided free of charge to

you upon request, or (B) if denial is based on medical judgment, either (i) an explanation of the scientific or clinical

judgment for the determination, applying the terms of the Policy to your medical circumstances, or (ii) a statement that

such explanation will be provided to you free of charge upon request.


Appealing Denials of Claims for Benefits


On any wholly or partially denied claim, you or your representative must appeal once to the Insurance Company for a full

and fair review. You must complete this claim appeal process before you file an action in court. Your appeal request

must be in writing and be received by the Insurance Company no later than the expiration of 180 days from the date you

received your claim denial. As part of your appeal:


1. you may request, free of charge, copies of all documents, records, and other information relevant to your claim; and

2. you may submit written comments, documents, records and other information relating to your claim.


The Insurance Company's review on appeal shall take into account all comments, documents, records and other

information submitted by you relating to the claim, without regard to whether such information was submitted or

considered in the initial benefit determination.


The Insurance Company will make a final decision no more than 45 days after it receives your timely appeal. The time for

final decision may be extended for one additional 45 day period provided that, prior to the extension, the Insurance

Company notifies you in writing that an extension is necessary due to special circumstances, identifies those

circumstances and gives the date by which it expects to render its decision. If your claim is extended due to your failure

to submit information necessary to decide your claim on appeal, the time for decision shall be tolled from the date on

which the notification of the extension is sent to you until the date we receive your response to the request.


The individual reviewing your appeal shall give no deference to the initial benefit decision and shall be an individual who is

neither the individual who made the initial benefit decision, nor the subordinate of such individual. The review process

provides for the identification of the medical or vocational experts whose advice was obtained in connection with an initial

adverse decision, without regard to whether that advice was relied upon in making that decision. When deciding an

appeal that is based in whole or part on medical judgment, we will consult with a medical professional having the

appropriate training and experience in the field of medicine involved in the medical judgment and who is neither an

individual consulted in connection with the initial benefit decision, nor a subordinate of such individual. If the Insurance

Company grants your claim appeal, the decision will contain information sufficient to reasonably inform you of that

decision.


                                                                 72

However, any final adverse benefit determination on review will be in writing and include: 1) specific reasons for the

decision, 2) specific references to the Policy provisions on which the decision is based, 3) a statement that you have the

right to bring a civil action under section 502(a) of ERISA, 4) a statement that you may request, free of charge, copies of

all documents, records, and other information relevant to your claim; 5) (A) if an internal rule, guideline, protocol, or other

similar criterion was relied upon in making the decision on appeal, either (i) the specific rule, guideline, protocol or other

similar criterion, or (ii) a statement that such a rule, guideline, protocol or other similar criterion was relied upon in making

the decision on appeal and that a copy will be provided free of charge to you upon request, or (B) if the decision on appeal

is based on medical judgment, either (i) an explanation of the scientific or clinical judgment for the decision on appeal,

applying the terms of the Policy to your medical circumstances, or (ii) a statement that such explanation will be provided to

you free of charge upon request, and 6) any other notice(s), statement(s) or information required by applicable law.



Claim Procedures for Claims Not Requiring a Determination of Disability


Claims for Benefits


If you or your authorized representative would like to file a claim for benefits for yourself or your insured dependents, you

or your authorized representative should obtain a claim form(s) from your Employer or Plan Administrator. The applicable

section of such form(s) must be completed by (1) you, (2) the Employer or Plan Administrator and (3) the attending

physician or hospital. Following completion, the claim form(s) must be forwarded to the Insurance Company's claim

representative. The Insurance Company will evaluate your claim and determine if benefits are payable.


The Insurance Company will make a decision no more than 90 days after receipt of your properly filed claim. However, if

the Insurance Company determines that special circumstances require an extension, the time for its decision will be

extended for an additional 90 days, provided that, prior to the beginning of the extension period, the Insurance Company

notifies you in writing of the special circumstances and gives the date by which it expects to render its decision. If

extended, a decision shall be made no more than 180 days after your claim was received. If the Insurance Company

approves your claim, the decision will contain information sufficient to reasonably inform you of that decision.


However, any adverse benefit determination will be in writing and include: 1) specific reasons for the decision; 2) specific

references to Policy provisions on which the decision is based; 3) a description of any additional material or information

necessary for you to perfect the claim and an explanation of why such material or information is necessary; 4) a

description of the review procedures and time limits applicable to such, and 5) a statement that you have the right to bring

a civil action under section 502(a) of ERISA after you appeal our decision and after you receive a written denial on appeal.


Appealing Denials of Claims for Benefits


On any wholly or partially denied claim, you or your representative must appeal once to the Insurance Company for a full

and fair review. You must complete this claim appeal process before you file an action in court. Your appeal request

must be in writing and be received by the Insurance Company no later than the expiration of 60 days from the date you

received your claim denial. As part of your appeal:


1. you may request, free of charge, copies of all documents, records, and other information relevant to your claim; and

2. you may submit written comments, documents, records and other information relating to your claim.


The Insurance Company's review on appeal shall take into account all comments, documents, records and other

information submitted by you relating to the claim, without regard to whether such information was submitted or

considered in the initial benefit determination.


The Insurance Company will make a final decision no more than 60 days after it receives your timely appeal. However, if

the Insurance Company determines that special circumstances require an extension, the time for its decision will be

extended for an additional 60 days, provided that, prior to the beginning of the extension period, the Insurance Company

notifies you in writing of the special circumstances and gives the date by which it expects to render its decision. If

extended, a decision shall be made no more than 120 days after your appeal was received. If the Insurance Company

grants your claim appeal, the decision will contain information sufficient to reasonably inform you of that decision.


However, any final adverse benefit determination on review will be in writing and include: 1) specific reasons for the

decision and specific references to the Policy provisions on which the decision is based, 2) a statement that you are

entitled to receive, upon request and free of charge, reasonable access to, and copies of, all documents, records and


                                                                 73

other information relevant to the claim, 3) a statement of your right to bring a civil action under section 502(a) of ERISA,

and 4) any other notice(s), statement(s) or information required by applicable law.
