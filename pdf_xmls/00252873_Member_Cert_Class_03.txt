              IMPORTANT NOTICE REGARDING ACCELERATED DEATH BENEFITS


    This Certificate contains an Accelerated Death Benefit provision within the Life Insurance section.
Benefits are payable as shown on the Schedule. Please refer to the Accelerated Death Benefit provision of
this Certificate for a complete benefit description.

    This Accelerated Death Benefit is NOT a long term care policy or a nursing home insurance policy.
You may use the Accelerated Death Benefit for any purpose. The Accelerated Death Benefit may be
taxable. As with all tax matters, You should consult a personal tax advisor to determine the tax
consequences prior to making an election for this benefit.


   LIFE INSURANCE WILL BE REDUCED IF AN ACCELERATED DEATH BENEFIT IS PAID.


    RECEIPT OF ACCELERATED DEATH BENEFITS MAY AFFECT ELIGIBILITY FOR PUBLIC
ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS SUCH AS, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, MEDICAID. Because the
Accelerated Death Benefit is part of this Certificate, You may be required to receive and spend all of the
available funds from the Certificate prior to becoming eligible for public assistance programs.

                                               Introduction


    Anthem Life Insurance Company certifies that it has issued a Group Policy insuring certain eligible
employees of the Plan Sponsor.

    This Certificate describes the benefits provided as of the effective date. For purposes of effective
dates and ending dates under the Policy, all days begin at 12:01 a.m. and end at 12:00 midnight at the
Plan Sponsor's address.

    Certain terms of the Group Policy which affect Your insurance are contained in the following pages.
Anthem Life has written this Certificate in plain English. However, a few terms and provisions are
written as required by insurance law. Anthem Life urges You to read Your Certificate carefully and keep it
in a safe place.

    If the terms and provisions of the Certificate (issued to You) are different from the Policy (issued to
the Plan Sponsor), the Policy will govern. Your coverage may be cancelled or changed in whole or in part
under the terms and provisions of the Policy.

    When making a benefit determination under the Policy, Anthem Life has discretionary authority to
interpret the terms and provisions of the Policy.

    The Group Policy was issued in the state of Wisconsin. Its laws and rules will govern in resolving
any questions about the Group Policy, except to the extent that the Policy may be governed by the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA).

    While You remain insured, this booklet is Your certificate of insurance. It replaces any prior booklet
or certificate given to You for the types of insurance described here. It is void and of no effect if You are
not entitled to or have ceased to be entitled to the insurance coverage. Many of the provisions of this
Certificate are interrelated, and You should read the entire Certificate to get a full understanding of Your
coverage. This Certificate also contains exclusions, so please be sure to read this Certificate carefully.

About This Schedule


     This Schedule of Benefits shows highlights of the coverage available under the Group Policy. Final
interpretation of all provisions and coverages will be governed by the Group Policy on file with Anthem
Life Insurance Company at its Administrative Office.

coverage for which You have not paid the required premium.

Basic Life Insurance


Amount of Your Basic Life Insurance


     $20,000




     Guarantee Issue Amount


     "Guaranteed Issue Amount" means an amount of insurance for which We do not require Proof of
Insurability.


     "Proof of Insurability" means evidence satisfactory to Us of a person's health and other information
related to insurability which enables Us to determine whether the person can become insured, or is
eligible for an increase in coverage.




     Proof of Insurability will be required for Benefit amounts of more than $20,000.
     No amount of Your Basic Life Insurance in excess of the Guaranteed Issue Amount shall become
effective prior to Our approval of Proof of Insurability.

     Earnings; or

   · We approve, in Writing, Proof of Insurability, if Proof of Insurability is required.

Proof of Insurability

You must give Proof of Insurability for Life coverages:



   · if You pay all or part of the premium for insurance and You enroll Yourself more than 31 days after

     amount of Your Annual Earnings or Your election, and Your Employer does not tell Us in Writing
     about the change within 31 days after the change occurs; or

   · if You pay all or part of the premium for Your insurance and the insurance ended at Your request or
     because a premium was not paid by You are re-applying for coverage; or

   · for insurance for which You pay all or part of the premium if You were entitled to coverage under
     the Prior Plan and You had declined coverage; or

   · if the amount of insurance initially or subsequently applied for exceeds the Guaranteed Issue
     Amount of the Policy shown in the Schedule of Benefits.



    We will use the Proof of Insurability form and other information You give as Proof of Insurability to
determine whether You can become Insured. If the Proof of Insurability is not satisfactory to Us, the
insurance for which You are required to give Proof of Insurability will not take effect. If the Proof is
accepted, Your insurance will only take effect on the first of the month following the date We approve
Your Proof of Insurability in Writing.

Insurance coverage as of the date You satisfy the Elimination Period.

     may become reasonably qualified by education, training, or experience; and

   · You are receiving Regular Care from a Physician for that Injury or Illness.


    The loss of a professional license, occupational license or certification does not in itself mean You
are Disabled. Loss of Your occupation due to economic factors such as, but not limited to, recession, job
elimination, pay cuts and job-sharing will not be considered.


    You will not be considered to be Totally Disabled on any day that you meet the definition of

individual life insurance policy in accordance with that policy's provisions.
    However, once You have met the conditions for Waiver of Premium You must surrender the
individual life insurance policy in accordance with its terms and receive a refund of Your premium
payments. You may not be insured simultaneously under both this Group Policy and an individual
policy issued in accordance with the Conversion of Life Insurance provision.

  1. We must receive initial Proof of Your Total Disability no later than 12 months after the date Your
     Total Disability began. This Proof must be satisfactory to Us.

  3. The insurance on Your life will be subject to any reductions in amount or termination of insurance
     included under the Group Policy as of the date You satisfy the Elimination Period which would
     have applied to You due to Your age if You were not Totally Disabled.

  4. Any amount of insurance continued in force under this provision that becomes payable will be
     reduced as follows:

        · By any amount paid under the terms of the Conversion provision of The Group Policy because
          death occurred within the 31 day period in which You were entitled to apply for a policy of
          individual life insurance; or
        · By any amount of insurance paid under a policy that was issued to You under the Conversion
          provision of the Group Policy after You became Totally Disabled, unless such policy was
          surrendered to Us without claim in exchange for a full refund of premiums paid under it.


Termination of Benefit

Your insurance continued in force under this provision will terminate on the earliest of the following.

   · The date on which You cease to be Totally Disabled; or
   · Three months after the date We request further Proof that You are still Totally Disabled if such
     Proof is not received within this period. We may ask for further Proof as often as We may
     reasonably require; or

   · The date of Your 65th birthday; or
   · The date You refuse to be examined by a Physician when requested; or

     entirely by You. This also includes retirement under any federal, state municipal, or association
     retirement plan.

    After We determine that You are Totally Disabled, Waiver of Premium for Life Insurance will not be
affected by:

   · termination of Your employment; or
   · termination of Your insurance coverage under the Policy; or

Insurance after Cessation of Total Disability

If Your insurance is continued in force under this provision and is then terminated because You cease to
be Totally Disabled or fail to submit any Proof of Total Disability that is required by Us, one of the
following events will occur.

   · If the Policy is in force and You are in a Class of persons who may be insured under the Policy and
     You are Actively at Work, You will immediately become insured under the other terms of the
     Policy; or

   · If the Policy is in force but either You are not in a Class of persons who may be insured under the
     Policy or You are not Actively at Work, You will be entitled to the same conversion rights that You
     would have been entitled to if Your insurance had terminated due to the termination of Your
     employment; or

   · If the Policy is not in force, You will be entitled to the same conversion rights that You would have
     been entitled to if You insurance had terminated due to the termination of the Policy.

    The period that a conversion right will apply to as described in clauses 2 and 3 will be the 31 days
following the date the insurance under this provision is terminated.
    If Your insurance is continued in force under this provision and is then terminated because Your
65th birthday has occurred, You will be entitled to the same conversion rights to which You would have
been entitled had Your insurance terminated because You are no longer an Insured under an eligible
Class.


Accelerated Death Benefit for Basic Life

The following Accelerated Death Benefit Provision applies to Your coverage for Basic Life Insurance:
    The Accelerated Death Benefit provides that a portion of the Basic Life Insurance proceeds otherwise
payable under the Policy as a result of death may be paid in advance under certain circumstances.
Payment is made if You are diagnosed as having a Terminal Condition, subject to the terms of the Policy
and this provision. All of the following conditions will apply:

   · You or Your legal representative must request in Writing to have this benefit paid while Your
     insurance is in effect.

   · We must be provided with the Written permission of Your irrevocable beneficiary or assignee for
     the life insurance proceeds otherwise payable under the Policy, prior to paying this benefit. If You
     live in a community property state, We must have Written permission of Your spouse.

   · At the time of application, You must be under age 60.
   · Premium payments must continue, and will be based on the reduced amount of Your insurance.
   · We must receive Proof satisfactory to Us that You have been diagnosed as having a Terminal
     Condition.

   · You must be living at the time this benefit is to be paid.
   · Accelerated Benefits are payable only once with respect to any Insured.

    Terminal Condition means a medical condition that a Physician expects to result in Your death
within 12 months from the date of application for the Accelerated Benefit and from which You are not
expected to recover.
    The amount of life insurance otherwise payable on Your death in accordance with the other terms of
the Policy will be reduced by the amount of this benefit. Such reduction will also apply to any amount
You would otherwise be eligible to apply for under the Conversion provision.
    If the life insurance applicable to You would otherwise reduce in accordance with the other terms of
the Policy within 12 months of the date of application for this benefit, then the benefit will be based on
such reduced amount. If Your insurance would otherwise terminate within 12 months of the date of
application for this benefit, then the Accelerated Death Benefit will not be paid.
    Payment of this benefit does not guarantee that Your full death benefit will eventually be paid.
Insurance must still be in force under the Policy at the time of Your death for the remainder of the life
insurance benefit to be paid. All limitations and exclusions under the Policy will still apply. Payment of
the Accelerated Death Benefit discharges Us of all liability under the Policy to the extent of the payment.


Amount of Benefit

Your Accelerated Death Benefit is an amount equal to the lesser of 75% of the amount of Basic Life
Insurance to which You are entitled on the date You apply in Writing for this benefit, to a maximum
benefit of $250,000.
    A lesser amount of Accelerated Benefit may be elected. However, the minimum Accelerated Death
Benefit We will consider for payment is $7,500.
    Payment will be made in one lump sum to You. If You have received an Accelerated Benefit and then
You recover from the qualifying condition, You will not be required to refund the benefit paid to You.


Exclusions

No Accelerated Death Benefit will be payable if any of the following conditions are true:


   · The Terminal Condition is directly or indirectly due to or associated with an intentional
     self-inflicted injury or suicide attempt whether committed while sane or insane.

   · We have been notified that all or a portion of Your Life Benefits are to be paid to Your former
     spouse as part of a divorce agreement.

   · The Terminal Condition is directly or indirectly due to or associated with Your committing or
     attempting to commit a felony, or engaging in any unlawful act or illegal occupation, or
     committing or provoking an unlawful act.

   · The Terminal Condition is directly or indirectly due to or associated with alcohol or drug abuse.

    If the Accelerated Death Benefit election is forced by creditors or government agencies, We will
honor it only to the extent required by law.
    We reserve the right to have You examined by one or more Physicians of Our choice in connection
with any claim for Accelerated Death Benefit. Such an examination will be done at Our expense. Final
determination of eligibility will be made by Us.

Conversion of Life Insurance

Who May Convert

You will have the right to have Us issue to You an individual life insurance policy without submitting
Proof of Insurability if all or part of Your insurance under the Group Policy terminates for any of the
following reasons:

  1. Your employment terminates while the Group Policy is in force.

  2. Your membership in a Class terminates while the Group Policy is in force.

  3. The Group Policy terminates. You must have been insured under the Group Policy for at least 5
     years.

  4. The Group Policy is amended to cancel the insurance on the Class of persons under which You
     were insured. You must have been insured under the Group Policy for at least 5 years.

    The policy will only be issued to You if You make a Written application to Us and the first premium
due for the policy is received at Our Administrative Office within 31 days of such termination or benefit
reduction. This 31 day period is the conversion period. The policy will not take effect until the end of
the conversion period.
    If You should die during the 31 day conversion period, and prior to becoming insured under a
policy again, an amount of insurance equal to the maximum amount for which You were entitled to
convert will be paid as a death benefit.
    The premium for the individual policy will be determined by the policy type, the risk classification
to which You belong, Our published rates in effect and Your age at the time of conversion as determined
from the date of your last birthday.


Individual Policies Available

The policy may be on any plan, other than term insurance, with level premiums and level death benefit,
which We are then issuing. It may not include any provision for disability, waiver of premium,
accelerated death benefits, accidental death or other special benefit.


Limits on the Amount of Individual Life Insurance That May Be Obtained

The amount of insurance You may select under the Conversion policy is subject to the following limits.

  1. It may not be less than the minimum amount for which We then issue such a policy.

  2. If You ceased to be insured because of reason 1 or 2 shown in the Who May Convert section of this
     provision, it may not be more than the amount of insurance that has been terminated, reduced by
     any amount of life insurance for which You may be or may become entitled under this or any
     group insurance policy within the conversion period.

  3. It may not exceed the amount of insurance that has been terminated less any applicable age
     reductions under the Group Policy.

  4. If You ceased to be insured because of reason 3 or 4 shown in the Who May Convert section of this
     provision, it may not be more than the smaller of the following amounts.

Notice of Conversion Right

The Plan Sponsor is required to give You Written notice of Your right to convert without submitting
Proof of Insurability. Written notice presented to You or mailed by the Plan Sponsor to Your last known

the time of the Accident. These benefits are subject to all of the terms and limitations of the Policy and

    · The Air Bag Benefit equals the lesser of (i) $10,000 or (ii) 10% of the amount of the Accidental
      Death and Dismemberment Insurance Benefit paid because of Your Accidental death in accordance
      with the Schedule of Losses.

    · Satisfactory Proof that Your death resulted from an Automobile Accident independent of all other
      causes, and that the Insured was wearing a seat belt at the time of the Accident must be received at
      the time of claim. Proof that the Automobile was equipped with Air Bags may also be required.

    · No payment will be made for an Air Bag Benefit if at the time of the Accident the Insured was not
      in a seat for which the Automobile provided an Air Bag, and wearing a Seat Belt.

    · A copy of the police accident report must be submitted with the claim. The report must certify the
      position of the Seat Belt.

    · No payment will be made for the Seat Belt or Air Bag benefit for any Insured who is driving or
      riding as a passenger if:

         the blood alcohol of the driver or operator of the Automobile is in excess of the legal limit in
           the jurisdiction in which the Accident occurred; or
         the use of any intoxicant or drug by the driver or operator of the Automobile is determined to
           be a contributing cause of the Accident, whether or not the intoxicant or drug was prescribed
           by a Physician.


     The Additional Benefit for Seat Belt and Air Bag will be payable to Your beneficiary, as determined in
accordance with the Beneficiary Provision(s) under the Policy.

     For the purposes of this Additional Benefit:

     Seat Belt means a properly installed seat belt, lap and shoulder restraint, or other restraint
approved by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

     Automobile means a motor vehicle licensed for use on public highways which is a self-propelled
passenger vehicle that has four wheels and an internal combustion engine. It may include electric
passenger vehicles and certain hybrids. It excludes all other motorized vehicles.

    Air Bag means an inflatable supplemental passive restraint system installed by the manufacturer of
the Automobile that inflates upon collision to protect an individual from Injury and death.


ADDITIONAL BENEFIT FOR COMA

If an Accidental Injury which results in a Loss payable under the terms of the Policy causes You to be in a
Coma continuously for at least 31 days We will pay an Additional Benefit. The Additional Benefit for
Coma will be payable annually for each month of continuous Coma, but in no event more than 8 years
on behalf of You. No Additional Benefit for Coma will be payable after the comatose condition has
ceased, whether by death, recovery or any other change of condition. The Additional Benefit will be 1%
of the Principal Sum for each month that You are in a Coma. In no event shall the total amount paid for
all Accidental Death and Dismemberment Benefits for an Insured exceed the Principal Sum.

     The Coma Benefit will be paid to the legally appointed guardian or conservator of Your finances.

     If, after qualifying for an Additional Benefit, You suffer another Loss covered under the terms of the
Policy, due to the same Accident that caused the comatose condition, the benefit paid for such other
Loss will be the benefit stated in the Schedule of Losses reduced by the total amount of benefits paid,
including the Additional Benefit for Coma which has been paid, with respect to You as a result of that
Accident. If You continue to qualify for an Additional Benefit for Coma after such other loss, the amount
of Additional Benefit for Coma paid annually will be redetermined in accordance with the calculation
stated above. Only one Coma Benefit will be paid for any one month of Coma, regardless of the number
of injuries contributing to or causing the Coma.

     We will require monthly Proof of the continuing Comatose condition. We retain the right to
investigate to determine whether the Comatose condition exists and continues.

     The Coma Benefit will be calculated at 1/30th of the monthly Coma Benefit for each day during a
period of coma of less than a full month.

     Coma and Comatose mean, for the purposes of this provision, a profound state of
unconsciousness from which You cannot be aroused to consciousness, even by powerful stimulation, as
determined by a Physician. You must be confined in a medical facility during a coma.


ADDITIONAL BENEFIT FOR COMMON CARRIER ACCIDENT

If You sustain an Accidental Injury which results in a Loss payable under the terms of the Policy, an
Additional Benefit of 25% of the Principal Sum will be paid, if Your Injury is sustained while You are
boarding, riding, or exiting as a fare-paying passenger in a Common Carrier.

     Common Carrier means a government licensed and regulated entity that is in the business of
transporting fare paying passengers. The term Common Carrier does not include:

   · chartered or other privately arranged transportation; or
   · taxis; or
   · limousines.


  6 General Provisions

Assignment

As part of Your estate plan, You may wish to assign ownership of any death benefits to someone else.
The Policy allows assignment of all present and future right, title, interest and incidents of ownership as
to: (a) any life insurance: (b) any disability provision of life insurance, and (c) any Accidental death
insurance under the Policy. The assignment will include, but is not limited to, the rights: (a) to make
any contribution required to keep the insurance in force; (b) to exercise any conversion privilege; and (c)
to change the beneficiary named.

     No assignment of rights, title, interest and incidents, of ownership will be binding on Us unless and
until the original of the form documenting the assignment, or a true copy of it is received and
acknowledged by Us at Our Administrative Office.

    We will have no responsibility:

   · for the validity or effect of any assignment; or
   · to provide any assignee with notices which We may be obligated to provide to You.

Currency

All payments made to or by Us will be made in United States dollars.


Class Membership

Insureds may be covered under only one Class at any time.


Misrepresentation

Any statement You make in an application to become insured is a representation and not a warranty. No
representation made by You in an application to become insured will be used to reduce or deny Your
claim or contest the validity of Your insurance unless:

   · Your insurance would not have been approved except for Your misrepresentation; and
   · Your misrepresentation is contained in a written instrument Signed by You; and
   · We give You or Your Dependents a copy of the written instrument that contains Your
      misrepresentation.


Incontestability

We will not use misrepresentations made by an Insured in a written application to contest the validity of
the insurance with respect to which such statement was made, after such insurance has been in force
prior to the contest for a period of two years during the Insured's lifetime, unless the misrepresentations
are fraudulent. This section does not prevent Us from using at any time a defense based on:

   · non-payment of premium; or
   · any other provision of the Policy; or
   · any other defense that is allowed by law.

Misstatement of Age or Other Facts

If Your age or any other fact was misstated, We will use the correct facts to determine whether You are
Insured and if so, for what amount and duration.

    In addition, the life insurance premium rate will be adjusted so that the premium paid would have
been correct for Your actual age. We may make this change back to the date coverage became effective
based on the misstated information.

Errors

You must be properly Insured under the Policy. An error or omission by the Plan Sponsor or by Us will
not cause You to become Insured. An error or omission by the Plan Sponsor or by Us will not cancel
insurance that should continue nor continue insurance that should end. The requirements of the Policy
must be properly met for any change in the amount of Your insurance to take effect. We have the right
to full recovery of any overpayments made. Such reimbursement will be required regardless of whether
the overpayment occurred due to an error by Us, or by an Insured or Insured's representative or
beneficiary, or the Plan Sponsor.


Agency

The Plan Sponsor or employer and any administrator appointed by the Plan Sponsor or employer shall
not be considered Our agents for any purpose. We are not liable for any of their acts or omissions.


Changes to Policy

The Policy may be amended at any time by written agreement between the Plan Sponsor and Us,
without the consent of or notice to any other individual. Any amendment to the Policy must be in
Writing and be attached to it. The amendment must bear the signature or a reproduction of the
signature of the President, a Vice President, or Secretary of Our company.


     If a person who is otherwise eligible for insurance is not Actively at Work on the Effective Date of
the amendment, the effective date with respect to that person will be on the date that he is again
Actively at Work. However, if the amendment reduces the amount of insurance to which the person is
entitled, the effective date will be the effective date of the amendment.


     It is understood that, if the Policy is amended during a person's continuous period of Disability, the
amendment will have no effect on the amount of his insurance during that same continuous period of
Disability.


Enforcement of Policy Terms

If at any time We do not enforce a provision of the Policy, We will still retain Our right to enforce that
provision at Our option after providing notice.


  7 Claims and Payment Provisions

How To Claim Benefits

Due written Proof of claim is required in order to receive benefits under the Policy. Claim forms are
available to You or Your beneficiary on request to the Plan Sponsor. For prompt payment, it is necessary
that the claim form be completed in full. For a claim for loss of life, a certified copy of the death
certificate must be provided to Us.

Notice of Claim

Notice of a claim must be given within 90 days after a covered Loss starts. If this is not reasonably
possible, notice must be given as soon as it becomes reasonably possible. Reference to a "loss" in this
provision and the provisions below means that an event occurred or an expense was incurred for which
a benefit is payable under the Policy. Written notice can be given to Us at Our Administrative Office or
to Our agent. The notice must identify You along with Your Group Policy number, and the name and
address of the Claimant.
    For a Waiver of Premium claim for loss due to disability, You must notify Us immediately if You
return to work in any capacity.



Claim Forms

When We receive the notice of claim, We will send the Claimant forms for filing Proof of Loss. The
needed forms may also be obtained from the Plan Sponsor. If these forms are not given to the Claimant
within 15 days, the Claimant will meet the Proof of Loss requirements by giving Us a Written statement
of the nature and extent of the Loss within the time limit stated in the Proof of Loss section.



Proof of Loss

Due Written Proof of Loss must be given to Us within 90 days after such Loss. Failure to furnish the
Proof within that time shall not invalidate or reduce the claim if it was not reasonably possible to give
Proof within such time, provided such Proof is given as soon as it becomes reasonably possible. But,
unless delayed by the Claimant's legal incapacity, the required Proof must be furnished within 2 years of
the specified time.



Filing Claim Forms

The Proof of Loss claim forms contain instructions as to how they should be completed and where they
should be sent. Claimants should be sure to fully complete the forms. Incomplete forms may delay the
processing of the claim.



Time Of Payment Of Claim

Indemnities payable under the Policy for any Loss will be paid as they accrue immediately upon receipt
of due Written Proof of Loss.


Payment of Claims

Any covered benefit for Your Loss of life will be payable in accordance with Your Written beneficiary
designation, subject to the Policy's provisions and applicable law. Covered benefits for all other Losses
are payable to You.

Claims and Payment Provisions                                                                         L-33




Beneficiary Provisions

Designated Beneficiary Provision

The beneficiary is the person or persons You designate to receive any benefit payable because of Your
death. The designation must be made in a Written statement on a form approved by Us.

    You may change beneficiaries at any time, subject to applicable law. To do so, You must provide a
Written statement on a new form.

    Any designation or change of beneficiary will be effective on the date of its execution, regardless of
whether or not You are living at the time it is given to Us. In the event You die before any designation or
change is recorded, any death benefit We may have already paid will be deducted from the amount
payable to a newly named beneficiary.

    If You designate more than one person to share any death benefit, You should specify on the form
how the benefit is to be divided among them. Otherwise, they will share the benefit equally. All rights of
any beneficiary cease if he or she dies before You do.


Alternate Payment Beneficiary Provision

The interests of a beneficiary who dies before You will accrue to the surviving beneficiaries. However, if
for all or part of Your insurance, no beneficiary has been properly designated in accordance with the
Policy provisions and applicable law, the amount of Your insurance for which there is no beneficiary will
be payable in equal shares to the first of the following categories of surviving beneficiaries:

   · Legal Spouse;
   · Natural and legally adopted children;
   · Mother and Father;
   · Brother and Sister;
   · Estate.
    If the Insured and the beneficiary die from the same accident, and the order of deaths cannot be
determined, We will pay the benefit as though the Insured survived the beneficiary.


Release for Payment

It may be that one or more persons have incurred expenses for an Insured's fatal condition or burial. If,
in Our judgment this is true, We may apply part of any death benefit toward reimbursement of such
persons. But the total amount of death benefit so applied shall not be more than $500. Then, the
beneficiary for the payment will receive only the unpaid balance of the death benefit.

    It may happen that the person to be paid a benefit (called the "payee") is legally unable to execute a
valid release for payment. If a payee is unable to execute a valid release, We may:

   · pay any providers on whose charges the claim is based toward satisfaction of those charges; or




                                             Life Certificate

   · pay any person or institution that has assumed custody and principal support of the payee. This
     will not be done, though, after claim is made by the payee's duly appointed legal representative.


    If the payee dies while any accrued benefits remain unpaid, We may pay any provider on whose
charges the claim is based toward satisfaction of those charges. Then, any benefits that still remain
unpaid can be paid to anyone related to You by blood or marriage.


    The payments under this Release for Payment provision may be made at Our discretion, subject to
applicable law, and will not exceed a total of $500. We will be discharged to the extent of any payments
made in good faith under this provision.


    If any person who is to receive a benefit payment is a minor or is not legally competent, then the
benefit payment will be made to the legally appointed guardian of the person's estate.


Physical Examinations

We shall have the right and opportunity to have any Insured person whose Injury or Illness is the basis
of a claim undergo an Independent Medical Exam. This may be done when and as often as We may
reasonably require. If the person has died, We may require an autopsy, unless it is prohibited by law.
Such examination or autopsy will be at Our expense.


Proof Of Continuing Disability for Waiver of Premium

From time to time You must give Proof satisfactory to Us at Your expense that You are still Disabled. We
will ask You for this Proof at reasonable intervals. We will stop Waiver of Premium Benefits if You do not
give Proof satisfactory to Us that You are still Totally Disabled. We may require You to provide Us with
the name and address for any Hospital, health facility or institution where You received treatment,
including all attending physicians, and to give us Your Written authorization to obtain additional
medical information, including but not limited to complete copies of medical records. We may
investigate Your claim at any time.


Proof Of Financial Loss

For any benefit which is based upon determination of a person's financial loss, We shall have the right to
require Written Proof of financial loss. This includes, but is not limited to:


   · statements of income;
   · tax returns, tax statements, and accountants' statements; and
   · any other Proof that We may reasonably require.

    We may perform financial audits at Our expense as often as We may reasonably require. Payment of
benefits may be contingent upon Proof of financial loss being satisfactory to Us.

Legal Actions

No action at law or in equity shall be brought to recover on the Policy prior to the expiration of 60 days
after Written Proof of Loss has been furnished in accordance with the requirements of the Policy. No
such action shall be brought after the expiration of 6 years after the time Written Proof of Loss is
required by the above terms. Legal action with respect to a claim that has been denied, in whole or in
part, shall be contingent upon having obtained Our reconsideration of that claim, as explained below.


Reconsideration Of A Denied Claim

Claims for benefits other than Waiver of Premium

If You or Your beneficiary's claim for benefits is totally or partially denied, We will provide a Written
notice. The notice will give the reasons for denial. If a Claimant does not agree with the reasons given,
the Claimant may request reconsideration of the claim.


    To do so, the Claimant must write to Us within the 60 days after receipt of the notice of denial. The
Claimant should indicate why he believes the claim was improperly denied, and include any additional
information, data, questions or comments which he or she thinks are appropriate. Unless We request
additional information, the Claimant will be advised of Our decision within 60 days after the Written
request for reconsideration is received.


    Our name and address for correspondence regarding claims appear in this Certificate. Our name and
address will also be on the initial notice of denial and any subsequent correspondence from Us.


Claims for Waiver of Premium

A decision for a Waiver of Premium claim will be made by Us within 45 days of the date the claim is filed.
    Under special circumstances, this decision may take up to another 60 days. You will be notified and
the reason for the delay will be explained to You. The decision will be sent to You in Writing.
    If You do not understand Our decision or You are not satisfied with it, You may request a review of
the denied claim within 180 days of receipt of Written notice that Your claim has been denied. You may
also review the pertinent documents and submit comments in Writing.
    A decision must be made within 45 days after the request for review is made, unless circumstances
of the claim require an extension, in which event the decision will be made as soon as possible, but not
longer than 90 days after the request for review is made.
    The decision will be in Writing and will include the reasons for the decision with reference to those
Policy provisions on which it is based.


Discretionary Authority for Benefit Determination

We will make the final decision on claims for benefits under the Policy. When making a benefit
determination, We will have discretionary authority to interpret the terms and provisions of the Policy.
This discretionary authority should not be construed to limit the legal action that may be taken by an
Insured or beneficiary in accordance with the Legal Actions provision of the Policy, and any applicable
state or federal law.

    STATEMENT OF ERISA RIGHTS
    The following statement is required by federal law and regulation:

    As a participant of Group Life, Accidental Death & Dismemberment, and Disability for Employees
of: Corix Infra Services US Inc., you are entitled to valuable financial protection - beyond your paycheck
- that is provided by this plan. These benefits have been summarized and described for you in this
Certificate so that you will have the facts you need for reference.
    Your group health care benefits have been affected by The Employee Retirement Income Security Act
of 1974 (ERISA) since September 2, 1974. ERISA was signed into law to provide additional protection of
your rights under this plan. The law does not require a company to provide benefits, but it does set
standards for any benefits a company wishes to offer. It also requires that you be fully informed of the
benefits you can except to receive and your rights under ERISA.
    It is your right to know about your benefit plans in detail. Therefore, in addition to the information
provided in this Certificate, you will receive each year - at no cost - a summary of the annual report of
the plan's financial activities. You can also review the various plan documents at your place of work or
receive copies of them at reasonable cost, if you file a written request with the Plan Administrator.
    You also have a right to expect that the people who are responsible for the activities of the plan,
who are called fiduciaries, act prudently and in your best interest. The plan fiduciaries have always acted
in this manner, and have a commitment to the company to continue to do so. They also have a
commitment under ERISA to make up any losses they may cause the plan through any imprudence.
    If your claim for a benefit is denied in whole or in part you must receive a written explanation of the
reason for the denial. You have the right to have the plan review and reconsider your claim.
    There are steps you can take to enforce your rights. You have a right to file suit if:

   ·       A fiduciary has misused funds;

   ·       The company improperly denies you a benefit;

   ·       The company fails to furnish within 30 days any documents you have requested in writing or;

   ·       The company discriminates against you for asserting your rights.

    We doubt that will ever happen, but the right to file suit and to get the Department of Labor to help
you is yours. The court will decide who should pay court costs and legal fees and could require the Plan
Administrator to provide materials you requested and pay you up to $110 a day until you receive the
materials. If you are successful the court may order the person you have sued to pay these costs and fees.
    If you lose, the court may order you to pay these costs and fees, for example, if it finds your claim is
frivolous.
    The company cannot dismiss you or discriminate against you to prevent you from obtaining
benefits or exercising your rights under ERISA.
    If you have any questions about this plan or your rights under ERISA, please contact the Plan
Administrator who will be glad to help you. You can also obtain such information at the nearest Area
Office of the U.S. Labor-Management Service Administration, Department of Labor.

Information That's Important to You

Every year, we're required to send you specific information about your rights, your benefits and more.
This can use up a lot of trees, so we've combined a couple of these required annual notices. Please take a
few minutes to read about:

   · State notice of privacy practices
   · HIPAA notice of privacy practices
   · Breast reconstruction surgery benefits

    Want to save more trees? Go to anthem.com and sign up to receive these types of notices by e-mail.


State notice of privacy practices

As mentioned in our Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) notice, we must
follow state laws that are stricter than the federal HIPAA privacy law. This notice explains your rights
and our legal duties under state law. This applies to life insurance benefits, in addition to health, dental
and vision benefits that you may have.


Your personal information

We may collect, use and share your nonpublic personal information (PI) as described in this notice. PI
identifies a person and is often gathered in an insurance matter.
    We may collect PI about you from other persons or entities, such as doctors, hospitals or other
carriers. We may share PI with persons or entities outside of our company - without your OK in some
cases. If we take part in an activity that would require us to give you a chance to opt out, we will contact
you. We will tell you how you can let us know that you do not want us to use or share your PI for a
given activity. You have the right to access and correct your PI. Because PI is defined as any information
that can be used to make judgments about your health, finances, character, habits, hobbies, reputation,
career and credit, we take reasonable safety measures to protect the PI we have about you. A more
detailed state notice is available upon request. Please call the phone number printed on your ID card.


HIPAA notice of privacy practices

This notice describes how health, vision and dental information about you may be used and disclosed,
and how you can get access to this information with regard to your health benefits. Please review it
carefully.
    We keep the health and financial information of our current and former members private, as
required by law, accreditation standards and our rules. This notice explains your rights. It also explains
our legal duties and privacy practices. We are required by federal law to give you this notice.

Your Protected Health Information

We may collect, use and share your Protected Health Information (PHI) for the following reasons and
others as allowed or required by law, including the HIPAA Privacy rule:
    For payment: We use and share PHI to manage your account or benefits; or to pay claims for
health care you get through your plan.
    For health care operations: We use and share PHI for health care operations.
    For treatment activities: We do not provide treatment. This is the role of a health care provider,
such as your doctor or a hospital.
    Examples of ways we use your information for payment, treatment and health care
operations:

   · We keep information about your premium and deductible payments.
   · We may give information to a doctor's office to confirm your benefits.
   · We may share explanation of benefits (EOB) with the subscriber of your plan for payment purposes.
   · We may share PHI with your health care provider so that the provider may treat you.
   · We may use PHI to review the quality of care and services you get.
   · We may use PHI to provide you with case management or care coordination services for conditions
     like asthma, diabetes or traumatic injury.

   · We may also use and share PHI directly or indirectly with health information exchanges for
     payment, health care operations and treatment. If you do not want your PHI to be shared for
     payment, health care operations, or treatment purposes in health information exchanges, please
     visit https://www.anthem.com/health-insurance/about-us/privacy for more information.

    To you: We must give you access to your own PHI. We may also contact you to let you know about
treatment options or other health-related benefits and services. When you or your dependents reach a
certain age, we may tell you about other products or programs for which you may be eligible. This may
include individual coverage. We may also send you reminders about routine medical checkups and tests.
    To others: In most cases, if we use or disclose your PHI outside of treatment, payment, operations
or research activities, we must get your OK in writing first. We must receive your written OK before we
can use your PHI for certain marketing activities. We must get your written OK before we sell your PHI.
If we have them, we must get your OK before we disclose your provider's psychotherapy notes. Other
uses and disclosures of your PHI not mentioned in this notice may also require your written OK. You
always have the right to revoke any written OK you provide.
    You may tell us in writing that it is OK for us to give your PHI to someone else for any reason. Also,
if you are present and tell us it is OK, we may give your PHI to a family member, friend or other person.
We would do this if it has to do with your current treatment or payment for your treatment. If you are
not present, if it is an emergency, or you are not able to tell us it is OK, we may give your PHI to a family
member, friend or other person if sharing your PHI is in your best interest.
    As allowed or required by law: We may also share your PHI for other types of activities including:

   · Health oversight activities;
   · Judicial or administrative proceedings, with public health authorities, for law enforcement reasons,
     and with coroners, funeral directors or medical examiners (about decedents);

   · Organ donation groups for certain reasons, for research, and to avoid a serious threat to health or
      safety;

   · Special government functions, for Workers' Compensation, to respond to requests from the U.S.
      Department of Health and Human Services, and to alert proper authorities if we reasonably believe
      that you may be a victim of abuse, neglect, domestic violence or other crimes; and

   · As required by law.

    If you are enrolled with us through an employer-sponsored group health plan, we may share PHI
with your group health plan. If your employer pays your premium or part of your premium, but does
not pay your health insurance claims, your employer is not allowed to receive your PHI - unless your
employer promises to protect your PHI and makes sure the PHI will be used for legal reasons only.
    Authorization: We will get an OK from you in writing before we use or share your PHI for any
other purpose not stated in this notice. You may take away this OK at any time, in writing. We will then
stop using your PHI for that purpose. But, if we have already used or shared your PHI based on your OK,
we cannot undo any actions we took before you told us to stop.
    Genetic information: We cannot use or disclose PHI that is an individual's genetic information
for underwriting.
    Race, Ethnicity, and Language. We may receive race, ethnicity, and language information
about you and protect this information as described in this Notice. We may use this information for
various health care operations which include identifying health care disparities, developing care
management programs and educational materials, and providing interpretation services. We do not use
race, ethnicity, and language information to perform underwriting, rate setting or benefit
determinations, and we do not disclose this information to unauthorized persons.


Your Rights

Under federal law, you have the right to:

   · Send us a written request to see or get a copy of certain PHI, including a request to receive a copy of
      your PHI through e-mail. It is important to note that there is some level of risk that your PHI could
      be read or accessed by a third party when it is sent by unencrypted e-mail. We will confirm that
      you want to receive PHI by unencrypted e-mail before sending it to you.

   · Ask that we correct your PHI that you believe is missing or incorrect. If someone else (such as your
      doctor) gave us the PHI, we will let you know so you can ask him or her to correct it.

   · Send us a written request to ask us not to use your PHI for treatment, payment or health care
      operations activities. We are not required to agree to these requests.

   · Give us a verbal or written request to ask us to send your PHI using other means that are
      reasonable. Also, let us know if you want us to send your PHI to an address other than your home
      if sending it to your home could place you in danger.

   · Send us a written request to ask us for a list of certain disclosures of your PHI. Call Customer
      Service at the phone number printed on your identification (ID) card to use any of these rights.
      Customer Service representatives can give you the address to send the request. They can also give
      you any forms we have that may help you with this process.

   · Right to a restriction for services you pay for out of your own pocket: If you pay in full for any
      medical services out of your own pocket, you have the right to ask for a restriction. The restriction
      would prevent the use or disclosure of that PHI for treatment, payment or operations reasons. If
      you or your provider submits a claim to Anthem, Anthem does not have to agree to a restriction
      (see Your Rights section above). If a law requires the disclosure, Anthem does not have to agree to
      your restriction.


How we protect information

We are dedicated to protecting your PHI, and have set up a number of policies and practices to help
make sure your PHI is kept secure.
     We have to keep your PHI private. If we believe your PHI has been breached, we must let you know.
     We keep your oral, written and electronic PHI safe using physical, electronic, and procedural means.
These safeguards follow federal and state laws. Some of the ways we keep your PHI safe include securing
offices that hold PHI, password-protecting computers, and locking storage areas and filing cabinets. We
require our employees to protect PHI through written policies and procedures. These policies limit access
to PHI to only those employees who need the data to do their job. Employees are also required to wear
ID badges to help keep people who do not belong out of areas where sensitive data is kept. Also, where
required by law, our affiliates and nonaffiliates must protect the privacy of data we share in the normal
course of business. They are not allowed to give PHI to others without your written OK, except as
allowed by law and outlined in this notice.


Potential Impact of Other Applicable Laws

HIPAA (the federal privacy law) generally does not preempt, or override, other laws that give people
greater privacy protections. As a result, if any state or federal privacy law requires us to provide you with
more privacy protections, then we must also follow that law in addition to HIPAA.


Contacting you

We, including our affiliates or vendors, may call or text any telephone numbers provided by you using
an automated telephone dialing system and/or a prerecorded message. Without limitation, these calls
may concern treatment options, other health-related benefits and services, enrollment, payment, or

Breast reconstruction surgery benefits

If you ever need a benefit-covered mastectomy, we hope it will give you some peace of mind to know
that your Anthem benefits comply with the Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act of 1998, which
provides for:

   · Reconstruction of the breast(s) that underwent a covered mastectomy.
   · Surgery and reconstruction of the other breast to restore a symmetrical appearance.
   · Prostheses and coverage for physical complications related to all stages of a covered mastectomy,
     including lymphedema.

    All applicable benefit provisions will apply, including existing deductibles, copayments and/or
co-insurance. Contact your Plan administrator for more information.
    For more information about the Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act, you can go
to the federal Department of Labor website at: dol.gov/ebsa/publications/whcra.html.
